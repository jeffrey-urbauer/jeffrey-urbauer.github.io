SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>If <span data-page="page_1"></span>there is any lingering uncertainty that the Koch brothers are the primary sponsors of climate-change doubt in the United States, it ought to be put to rest by the publication of  “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476775389/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America</a>,” by the business reporter Christopher Leonard. This seven-hundred-and-four-page tome doesn’t break much new political ground, but it shows the extraordinary behind-the-scenes influence that Charles and David Koch have exerted to cripple government action on climate change.</p><p>Leonard, who has written for <em class="">Bloomberg Businessweek</em> and the <em class="">Wall Street Journal</em>, devotes most of the book to an even-handed telling of how the two brothers from Wichita, Kansas, built up Koch Industries, a privately owned business so profitable that together they have amassed some hundred and twenty billion dollars, a fortune larger than that of Amazon’s C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, or the Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The project took Leonard more than six years to finish and it draws on hundreds of hours of interviews, including with Charles Koch, the C.E.O. and force without equal atop the sprawling corporate enterprise. (David Koch retired from the firm last year.)</p><p>While “Kochland” is more focussed on business than on politics, in line with Leonard’s “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1451645813/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Meat Racket: The Secret Takeover of America’s Food Business</a>,” from 2014, it nonetheless adds new details about the ways in which the brothers have leveraged their fortune to capture American politics. Leonard shows that the Kochs’ political motives are both ideological, as hardcore free-market libertarians, and self-interested, serving their fossil-fuel-enriched bottom line. The Kochs’ secret sauce, as Leonard describes it, has been a penchant for long-term planning, patience, and flexibility; a relentless pursuit of profit; and the control that comes from owning some eighty per cent of their business empire themselves, without interference from stockholders or virtually anyone else.</p><p>Saying anything new about the Kochs isn’t easy. The two brothers have been extensively covered: they are the  subject of Daniel Schulman’s excellent biography “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LTHXJT6/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sons of Wichita</a>,” from 2014,  and the focus of much in-depth investigative reporting, including a piece I wrote <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/covert-operations">for <em class="">The New Yorker</em></a>, from 2010, and my book “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307947904/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right</a>,” from 2016.</p><p>Leonard, nonetheless, manages to dig up valuable new material, including evidence of the Kochs’ role in perhaps the earliest known organized conference of climate-change deniers, which gathered just as the scientific consensus on the issue was beginning to gel. The meeting, in 1991, was sponsored by the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank, which the Kochs founded and heavily funded for years. As Leonard describes it, Charles Koch and other fossil-fuel magnates sprang into action that year, after President George H. W. Bush announced that he would support a treaty limiting carbon emissions, a move that posed a potentially devastating threat to the profits of Koch Industries. At the time, Bush was not an outlier in the Republican Party. Like the Democrats, the Republicans largely accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, reflected in the findings of expert groups such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which had formed in 1988, under the auspices of the United Nations.</p><p>The Kochs’ key role in stopping congressional action on climate change is well-known, but longtime environmental activists, such as Kert Davies, the director of the Climate Investigation Center, credit Leonard with discovering that the Kochs played an earlier and even more central role in climate-change denial than was previously understood. In 2010, Davies authored a report, for Greenpeace, that labelled the Kochs “The Kingpins of Denial,” but he told me that he hadn’t realized that their role went as far back as 1991. (A copy of a flyer for the Cato conference can be seen at <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://kochdocs.org/" target="_blank">Koch Docs</a>, a new digital collaborative-research project, directed by the liberal corporate watchdog Lisa Graves, which tracks the Kochs’ influence.)</p><p>According to “Kochland,” the 1991 conference was called “Global Environmental Crisis: Science or Politics?” It featured many of the same characters who have spread doubt about the reality of climate change and continue to challenge the advisability of acting against it. Among the speakers was Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at M.I.T., who is quoted in the brochure as saying there was “very little evidence at all” that climate change would be “catastrophic.”</p><p>“Kochland” is important, Davies said, because it makes it clear that “you’d have a carbon tax, or something better, today, if not for the Kochs. They stopped anything from happening back when there was still time.” The book also documents how, in 2010, the company’s lobbyists spent gobs of cash and swarmed Congress as part of a  multi-pronged effort to kill the first, and so far the last, serious effort to place a price on carbon pollution—the proposed “cap and trade” bill. Magnifying the Kochs’ power was their network of allied donors, anonymously funded shell groups, think tanks, academic centers, and nonprofit advocacy groups, which Koch insiders referred to as their “echo chamber.” Leonard also reports that the centrist think tank Third Way quietly worked with the Kochs to push back against efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could have affected their business importing oil from Canada. Frequently, and by design, the Koch brothers’ involvement was all but invisible.</p><p>Others have chronicled the cap-and-trade fight well, but Leonard penetrates the inner sanctum of the<span data-page="page_final"></span> Kochs’ lobbying machine, showing that, from the start, even when other parts of the company could have benefitted from an embrace of alternative energy, Koch Industries regarded any compromise that might reduce fossil-fuel consumption as unacceptable. Protecting its fossil-fuel profits was, and remains, the company’s top political priority. Leonard shows that the Kochs, to achieve this end, worked to hijack the Tea Party movement and, eventually, the Republican Party itself.</p><p>Scientists who worked for Koch Industries adopted the company line; Leonard quotes a former company scientist, who embraced the conspiracy theory that élites invented a global-warming “hoax” as a way to unite Americans against a common enemy after the Cold War. Leonard also quotes Philip Ellender, Koch Industries’ top lobbyist, as claiming, in 2014, that the Earth had gotten cooler in the previous eighteen years. In fact, according to <em class="small">NASA</em>, eighteen of the nineteen hottest years on record have occurred in the past two decades. Yet the Koch machine bought its way into Congress and turned climate-change denial into an unchallengeable Republican talking point. Meanwhile, after the cap-and-trade bill died, the planet continued heating, and the Kochs’ net worth doubled.</p><p>Because the Kochs opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump, in 2016, many have assumed that they are antagonistic to the Trump Administration. To the contrary, Leonard writes, with the help of allies such as <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence">Vice-President Mike Pence</a>, “the politics that the Kochs stoked in 2010 became the policies that Trump enacted in 2017.” Whether announcing his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, placing shills from the oil and coal industries at the head of federal energy and environmental departments, or slashing taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy, Trump has delivered for the Kochs. “Kochland” quotes Charles Koch telling his allied political donors, in 2018, “We’ve made more progress in the last five years than I had in the previous fifty.”</p><p>Leonard’s grasp of political details isn’t always completely firm. He describes the late Senator Arlen Specter, a moderate from Pennsylvania, as being a “conservative” Republican prior to his switch to the Democratic Party. And Leonard misconstrues the origin of the term “Kochtopus,” which was coined not recently by political critics but decades ago by rival libertarians who derided the Kochs for putting self-interest above principle. But “Kochland” is deeply and authoritatively reported, and, while it can be overly cautious in the conclusions that it draws, it marshals a huge amount of information and uses it to help solve two enduring mysteries: how the Kochs got so rich, and how they used that fortune to buy off American action on climate change.</p></div></div></div></div><footer

The project took Leonard more than six years to finish and it draws on hundreds of hours of interviews, including with Charles Koch, the C.E.O. and force without equal atop the sprawling corporate enterprise. (David Koch retired from the firm last year.)"],["p","While “Kochland” is more focussed on business than on politics, in line with Leonard’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Meat-Racket-Takeover-Americas-Business/dp/1451645813"},"The Meat Racket: The Secret Takeover of America’s Food Business"],",” from 2014, it nonetheless adds new details about the ways in which the brothers have leveraged their fortune to capture American politics. Leonard shows that the Kochs’ political motives are both ideological, as hardcore free-market libertarians, and self-interested, serving their fossil-fuel-enriched bottom line. The Kochs’ secret sauce, as Leonard describes it, has been a penchant for long-term planning, patience, and flexibility; a relentless pursuit of profit; and the control that comes from owning some eighty per cent of their business empire themselves, without interference from stockholders or virtually anyone else."],["p","Saying anything new about the Kochs isn’t easy. The two brothers have been extensively covered: they are the  subject of Daniel Schulman’s excellent biography “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Sons-Wichita-Brothers-Americas-Powerful/dp/B01LTHXJT6"},"Sons of Wichita"],",” from 2014,  and the focus of much in-depth investigative reporting, including a piece I wrote ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/covert-operations"},"for ",["em","The New Yorker"]],", from 2010, and my book “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0307947904"},"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right"],",” from 2016."],["p","Leonard, nonetheless, manages to dig up valuable new material, including evidence of the Kochs’ role in perhaps the earliest known organized conference of climate-change deniers, which gathered just as the scientific consensus on the issue was beginning to gel. The meeting, in 1991, was sponsored by the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank, which the Kochs founded and heavily funded for years. As Leonard describes it, Charles Koch and other fossil-fuel magnates sprang into action that year, after President George H. W. Bush announced that he would support a treaty limiting carbon emissions, a move that posed a potentially devastating threat to the profits of Koch Industries. At the time, Bush was not an outlier in the Republican Party. Like the Democrats, the Republicans largely accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, reflected in the findings of expert groups such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which had formed in 1988, under the auspices of the United Nations."],["p","The Kochs’ key role in stopping congressional action on climate change is well-known, but longtime environmental activists, such as Kert Davies, the director of the Climate Investigation Center, credit Leonard with discovering that the Kochs played an earlier and even more central role in climate-change denial than was previously understood. In 2010, Davies authored a report, for Greenpeace, that labelled the Kochs “The Kingpins of Denial,” but he told me that he hadn’t realized that their role went as far back as 1991. (A copy of a flyer for the Cato conference can be seen at ",["a",{"href":"http://kochdocs.org/"},"Koch Docs"],", a new digital collaborative-research project, directed by the liberal corporate watchdog Lisa Graves, which tracks the Kochs’ influence.)"],["p","According to “Kochland,” the 1991 conference was called “Global Environmental Crisis: Science or Politics?” It featured many of the same characters who have spread doubt about the reality of climate change and continue to challenge the advisability of acting against it. Among the speakers was Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at M.I.T., who is quoted in the brochure as saying there was “very little evidence at all” that climate change would be “catastrophic.”"],["p","“Kochland” is important, Davies said, because it makes it clear that “you’d have a carbon tax, or something better, today, if not for the Kochs. They stopped anything from happening back when there was still time.” The book also documents how, in 2010, the company’s lobbyists spent gobs of cash and swarmed Congress as part of a  multi-pronged effort to kill the first, and so far the last, serious effort to place a price on carbon pollution—the proposed “cap and trade” bill. Magnifying the Kochs’ power was their network of allied donors, anonymously funded shell groups, think tanks, academic centers, and nonprofit advocacy groups, which Koch insiders referred to as their “echo chamber.” Leonard also reports that the centrist think tank Third Way quietly worked with the Kochs to push back against efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could have affected their business importing oil from Canada. Frequently, and by design, the Koch brothers’ involvement was all but invisible."],["p","Others have chronicled the cap-and-trade fight well, but Leonard penetrates the inner sanctum of the",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22final%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," Kochs’ lobbying machine, showing that, from the start, even when other parts of the company could have benefitted from an embrace of alternative energy, Koch Industries regarded any compromise that might reduce fossil-fuel consumption as unacceptable. Protecting its fossil-fuel profits was, and remains, the company’s top political priority. Leonard shows that the Kochs, to achieve this end, worked to hijack the Tea Party movement and, eventually, the Republican Party itself."],["p","Scientists who worked for Koch Industries adopted the company line; Leonard quotes a former company scientist, who embraced the conspiracy theory that élites invented a global-warming “hoax” as a way to unite Americans against a common enemy after the Cold War. Leonard also quotes Philip Ellender, Koch Industries’ top lobbyist, as claiming, in 2014, that the Earth had gotten cooler in the previous eighteen years. In fact, according to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NASA"],", eighteen of the nineteen hottest years on record have occurred in the past two decades. Yet the Koch machine bought its way into Congress and turned climate-change denial into an unchallengeable Republican talking point. Meanwhile, after the cap-and-trade bill died, the planet continued heating, and the Kochs’ net worth doubled."],["p","Because the Kochs opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump, in 2016, many have assumed that they are antagonistic to the Trump Administration. To the contrary, Leonard writes, with the help of allies such as ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence"},"Vice-President Mike Pence"],", “the politics that the Kochs stoked in 2010 became the policies that Trump enacted in 2017.” Whether announcing his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, placing shills from the oil and coal industries at the head of federal energy and environmental departments, or slashing taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy, Trump has delivered for the Kochs. “Kochland” quotes Charles Koch telling his allied political donors, in 2018, “We’ve made more progress in the last five years than I had in the previous fifty.”"],["p","Leonard’s grasp of political details isn’t always completely firm. He describes the late Senator Arlen Specter, a moderate from Pennsylvania, as being a “conservative” Republican prior to his switch to the Democratic Party. And Leonard misconstrues the origin of the term “Kochtopus,” which was coined not recently by political critics but decades ago by rival libertarians who derided the Kochs for putting self-interest above principle. But “Kochland” is deeply and authoritatively reported, and, while it can be overly cautious in the conclusions that it draws, it marshals a huge amount of information and uses it to help solve two enduring mysteries: how the Kochs got so rich, and how they used that fortune to buy off American action on climate change."]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/kochland-examines-how-the-koch-brothers-made-their-fortune-and-the-influence-it-bought","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8881ab3335f580f188","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8881ab3335f580f188","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Koch

considered bringing hate-crime charges against [the gunman who opened fire in El Paso](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-virality-of-evil), the Mexican Foreign Minister did not waver. At a press conference in Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard spoke solemnly about the massacre, which took the lives of eight of his fellow-countrymen. “Mexico is indignant,” he said, adding, “We will not meet hate with hate, we will act with reason and within the law, but with firmness.” Ebrard announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General’s Office would look into a series of possible legal actions, such as bringing a criminal case against the shooter, charging him with committing acts of terrorism against Mexicans in the United States, demanding his extradition, and suing the seller of the assault-style rifle that he had used. Ebrard answered no questions, but he concluded his remarks by saying that, via diplomatic channels, his team would urge its American counterparts to take “a clear and forceful position against hate crimes.”\n\nEbrard’s remarks were notably stern, especially considering that the Mexican government has often wavered in its responses to Trumpian tactics. When [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) was still a candidate, then President [Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico City](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/mexico-in-the-age-of-trump) and treated him, in effect, like a head of state, despite the fact that he had insulted Mexicans in the very moment that he announced his campaign. Since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was sworn in, last December, he has made [a number of concessions](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-mexico-lopez-obrador-takes-powerand-a-leftist-stance-against-trump) to Trump, most recently in May, when Trump threatened to impose tariffs of up to twenty-five per cent on all Mexican goods unless Mexico agreed to implement several policies designed to [curb the flow of Central American migrants](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-trumps-tariff-threat-could-outsource-the-asylum-crisis-to-mexico) into the United States. A negotiating team led by Ebrard averted the tariffs, pledging to deploy the national guard throughout Mexico’s territory and let migrants stay there while waiting for their asylum claims to be processed in the United States. Within a month, the number of individuals apprehended at the southern border dropped by almost thirty per cent.\n\nThis strategy of eluding confrontation has continued to shape Mexico’s stance toward Trump. Because the United States is Mexico’s largest trading partner and both countries’ economies are closely intertwined, yielding can seem like less of a moral predicament than a necessary condition. Faced with vitriol, threats to close the southern border, or even [U.S. agents firing tear gas into Mexico](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/is-tear-gas-at-the-mexico-us-border-the-new-normal), authorities have consistently attempted to limit a fallout between both countries. It’s a herculean task, but one that inhibits much strategizing. “Everything has turned into an emergency situation,” Alexandra Délano, a professor of global studies at the New School, told me. “Mexicans are failing to look into the roots of the anti-immigrant sentiment and asking ourselves, Where does this lack of understanding, these xenophobic acts, and this willingness to use migrants as a political scapegoat come from?”\n\nSaturday’s shooting was the deadliest attack against Hispanics in modern U.S. history. The gunman settled on El Paso precisely because of its Hispanic heritage—the city is eighty per cent Latino—and drove more than six hundred miles for the sole purpose of slaying Mexicans. “The reason why we all feel caught by surprise is because El Paso is one of the safest and most binational cities in the United States,” Martha Bárcena, the Mexican Ambassador to the United States, told me. Six of the Mexican nationals who lost their lives on Saturday came from the border states of Chihuahua and Coahuila. Two had retired in El Paso. One was in town to pick up her daughter at the airport, and another ran into the store for a quick errand, while her family waited in the Walmart parking lot. Minutes before the first shots were fired, an unsigned manifesto titled “The Inconvenient Truth” surfaced online. Its author refers to a “Hispanic invasion of Texas,” in total disregard for the fact that the presence of Hispanics predates the state’s existence. And its language echoes that of a President who cast Mexicans as “rapist and criminals” and who, at a recent rally, when a member of the crowd claimed that only bullets could “stop” migrants, simply chuckled.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe events in El Paso have seemingly emboldened the Mexican authorities to readdress the terms of their relationship with the Trump Administration. “We’re talking guns, the border, and immigration—the most sensitive issues between the two countries,” Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst in Mexico City, told me. “Words may kill, but gun use in the United States, which we’ve come to accept as if it were the law of gravity, is all the more lethal.” Fully addressing these issues will require a debate around the responsibilities that each country bears. Weak gun laws are a clear example of how a predicament, which originates in the United States, can have [transnational implications](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-link-between-americas-lax-gun-laws-and-the-violence-that-fuels-immigration). Mexicans living in the United States are as exposed to the lethality of guns as any American, but those living in Mexico are exposed to the estimated two hundred thousand weapons that get smuggled across the border into their country every year.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Mexican authorities will be able to follow through on the legal actions they have outlined. “There is always a gap between what is politically convenient and what is legally viable,” Ximena Medellín, a law professor at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching, told me. The Mexican government would first have to prove that the shooting violated Mexico’s terrorism laws, only to face limited prospects for an extradition if U.S. prosecutors seek to impose the death penalty. According to Medellín, Mexico’s involvement in the U.S. investigation is unlikely given that American authorities have already launched a criminal case against the gunman and pressed charges for the same crimes laid out by the Mexican government. “It would be wiser to deepen our mutual security and intelligence treaties,” Medellín said. “Mexico should seek out to its partners in Congress and across the government, who have proven that the United States is much more than a bad Presidency.” \n\nIn the realm of politics, there is more Mexico can do to serve as a counterweight to Trump’s discourse. The country’s dependency on its northern neighbor can seem a deterrent, but it should also be a reminder of mutual reliance. “Grandstanding is no way to respond to Trump, and in diplomacy you should never fight flatulence with more flatulence,” Arturo Sarukhán, who served as Mexico’s Ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013, told me. “But by constantly seeking to bend backwards and appease Trump, and in the process signalling weakness and an unwillingness to draw red lines or speak up when needed, Mexico will only embolden President Trump to continue to ambush the relationship with ultimatums and unilateral decisions.” \n\nMexican-Americans living in the U.S. can also confer a political cost on the President’s attempts to treat them as second-class citizens. The Pew Research Center recently estimated that in the next election, and for the first time in the United States’ history, Hispanics will be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate. Although the numbers vary by state, a majority of the thirty-two million eligible Hispanic voters are of Mexican descent. If history has not served as a strong enough reality check, perhaps ballots will. As Bárcena said, “Mexicans play a part in the past, the present, and the future of the United States.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass

According to the document, the young man was inspired by the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. In Texas, his goal was to murder as many Hispanic civilians as possible. Carrying an AK-47-style assault rifle, he [killed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence) twenty people and wounded twenty-six others. Apparently, he intended to spark a race war—or, rather, to accelerate a race war that he already believed to be in progress. “Do your part and spread this brothers!” he wrote on 8chan. “Keep up the good fight.”\n\nWhite-supremacist terrorism is nothing new, but this sickeningly specific instantiation of it—lone shooter, assault rifle, online manifesto, a link to a live stream—appears to be contagious. Thirteen hours after the massacre in El Paso, a shooter opened fire outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio. It’s not yet clear what his motive was, but eyewitnesses described him as a white man in his twenties. On Saturday, 8chan users passed around a Google spreadsheet listing some of these shootings: date, location, number of kills. Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who are commonly referred to on 8chan as “martyrs,” were at the top of the list. The El Paso shooter was at the bottom. It’s hard to imagine that this list won’t keep growing.\n\nThe national conversation will now turn, as it should, to gun control, to mental illness, and to [the President’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) practice of exacerbating racial tensions, which has been one of his avocations for decades and now appears to be his central reëlection strategy. But there’s also a more specific question: what can be done about the fact that so many of these terrorists—in [Pittsburgh](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pittsburgh-shooting-and-the-dark-specific-logic-of-online-hatred), in [Poway](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-poway-synagogue-shooting-follows-an-unsettling-new-script), in [Christchurch](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-zealand-shooting-and-the-great-man-theory-of-misery), in El Paso—seem to find inspiration in the same online spaces? Each killer, in the moment, may have acted alone, but they all appear to have been zealous converts to the same ideology—a paranoid snarl of raw anger, radical nationalism, unhinged nihilism, and fears of “white genocide” that is still referred to as “fringe,” although it’s creeping precariously close to the mainstream. On many social networks that bill themselves as bulwarks of “free speech,” including Gab, 4chan, and 8chan, this way of thinking is so dominant that it is often taken for granted. In April, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that such platforms “serve as round-the-clock white supremacist rallies.”\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nCan these platforms simply be shut down? The answer is complicated, but basically binary: there is a lot that private companies can do to censor speech, but much less that the government can do. The United States has some of the most expansive free-speech protections in the world. There are exceptions, such as incitement to violence, but the bar to prove incitement is quite high. In the nineteen-sixties, a Ku Klux Klan leader was arrested under an Ohio law that prohibited advocating “crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism.” But the Supreme Court—at the time, arguably the most liberal Court in American history—ruled unanimously that the Klan leader’s First Amendment rights had been violated. This case, Brandenburg v. Ohio, laid out the standard that still applies: the government can only censor speech if it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action.” Some of the recent white-supremacist manifestos might meet this standard, and yet, even if one or several of them could be banned, this wouldn’t necessarily apply to the platforms on which the manifestos are posted. According to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, a site’s owner is not liable for the content on that site. In March, the Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/22/chan-looks-like-terrorist-recruiting-site-after-new-zealand-shooting-should-government-treat-it-like-one/?utm_term=.56d68796a5ed) that the owner of 8chan, Jim Watkins, an American living in the Philippines, had “built a technical fortress to guard 8chan from potential takedowns.” The site’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer works at the company, told the *Post* that Watkins was “content to lose money” on the site: “8chan is like a boat to Jim.” A boat may be full of snakes, or explosives, but this doesn’t guarantee that the government will be able to seize it.\n\nStill, even in the absence of government intervention, there are other pressures that can be brought to bear. In August of 2017, a few days after the white-supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, a Web-security company called Cloudflare severed its relationship with a neo-Nazi propaganda site called the Daily Stormer. Without Cloudflare’s protection, the Daily Stormer would be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, allowing [online vigilantes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers) to crash the site more or less at will. “Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion,” Matthew Prince, the C.E.O. of Cloudflare, [wrote](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) on the company’s blog. “Now, having made that decision, let me explain why it’s so dangerous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.”\n\nCloudflare still offers its protective services to 8chan. “We’re the Fedex of the internet, passing messages on, not looking inside the boxes,” Cloudflare’s head of policy told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/03/15/after-the-new-zealand-terror-attack-should-8chan-be-wiped-from-the-web/#192d45e96263) in March. But, after Cloudflare had made an exception to this rule by banning the Daily Stormer, this was no longer entirely true. “It’s powerful to be able to say you’ve never done something,” Prince wrote in his blog post. “And, after today, make no mistake, it will be a little bit harder for us to argue against a government somewhere pressuring us into taking down a site they don’t like.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Terrorism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"terrorism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00be2179605b11ad993c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Andrew Marantz, a staff writer, has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2011.

It had just endured eight days of arson and violence, which had claimed the lives of thirty-eight people—fifteen of them white, twenty-three of them black—including John Simpson, the sole police officer killed during the unrest. More than five hundred people were injured. Ostensibly, the violence began when Eugene Williams, a seventeen-year-old African-American, went swimming and rafting with his friends on Lake Michigan and drifted toward a part of the beach used only by whites. A white man named George Stauber began hurling stones at Williams, who eventually slipped beneath the water and drowned. Racial skirmishes broke out along the beach and spread across the city, lighting kindling that had been laid throughout the previous year. Thousands of black soldiers returning from the First World War competed against white workers for employment and housing. The veterans brought with them a renewed intolerance for discrimination, an attitude summarized in an editorial by W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du&nbsp;Bois in the magazine *The Crisis*. “By the God of Heaven,” Du&nbsp;Bois wrote, “we are cowards and jackasses if now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.” Other African-Americans, newly arrived migrants from the South, as part of what became known as the Great Migration, were viewed as interlopers whose willingness to work for low pay undercut the wages of white men. As the poet Eve Ewing notes in her searing collection “[1919](https://www.amazon.com/1919-Eve-L-Ewing/dp/1608466027),” white Chicagoans attributed the violence to a “Negro invasion” of previously white enclaves. The world had been made safe for democracy; Chicago had not. \n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d499b1ae9367a0009f6a95b]||||||\n+++\n\nThis past Saturday, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project held events across the city, including a bike tour and panel discussions, to memorialize the dead and to detail the legacy of that week of chaos and terror. The same day, fifteen hundred miles to the south, in [El Paso, Texas](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/trump-the-accomplice-el-paso-residents-blame-the-president-for-a-hate-fuelled-mass-shooting), there was a different commemoration taking place, one more akin to a dramatic reënactment than a sombre reflection—the past climbing out from its shallow grave to place its claim on the present. Twenty-two people died at the hands of a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle and [a list of grievances](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-virality-of-evil) yellowed by a century of repetition. A manifesto believed to be written by the shooter cites the “Hispanic invasion of Texas”—a contortion of history if ever there was one—as a motive for the murders. Another section of that document offers a disclaimer meant to indemnify [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump). “My ideology has not changed for several years,” it states. “My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president.” This is notable, in the sense that unsolicited denials often sound like direct admissions. In the past month, Trump has urged four sitting members of Congress—Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib—all women of color, to [“go back” to where they came from](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/donald-trumps-idea-of-selective-citizenship), and attacked a fifth representative, Elijah Cummings, an African-American, [by claiming](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-elijah-cummings-and-the-definition-of-a-rodent) that his district is “disgusting,” rat-infested, and beneath human habitability. Trump followed that with a tweet appearing to jeer when Cummings reported that his home had been burglarized. The language of the alleged El Paso shooter’s screed bears resemblance to Trump’s rhetoric, particularly in the martial description of undocumented people as an “invasion.” If the immediate conversation in the aftermath of El Paso—and the massacre of nine people [thirteen hours later, in Dayton, Ohio](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence)—has tended toward the accessibility of weapons of war in civilian life, the word “invasion” becomes even more telling. We are not, the killers seem to be telling us, living in peacetime. An AK-47 is a tool created to address enemy invasions. \n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn remarks delivered at the White House on Monday, Trump explicitly denounced white supremacy, just as he eventually did after first praising the “very fine people” at the “Unite the Right” [rally in Charlottesville](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-battle-of-charlottesville), two years ago this weekend. (He reverted to form a few months later by referring to Haiti and African countries as “shitholes.”) Just as he criticized people who chanted, about Ilhan Omar, “Send her back!,” at a rally three weeks ago. (He followed that by reversing that criticism and launching more racist tweets a week later.) Trump’s mindless belligerence, his perilous and ignorant world view, and, particularly, his use of inflammatory racist rhetoric are rightly seen as alarming. The Presidency is the most esteemed and powerful platform in the country, and it is reasonable to see a relationship between the President’s imprimatur and the ballistic bedlam that regularly erupts and targets people and groups for whom he has expressed contempt. Cesar Sayoc, who on Monday was sentenced to twenty years in prison for sending sixteen homemade pipe bombs to people whom he deemed enemies of the President, argued that his perspective was skewed by mental illness—and also by his obsessive admiration of Trump. This, for the record, is why people in public life are supposed to be mindful of their rhetoric. Their words reach a wide swath of the public, which has varying abilities to interpret their meaning and their nuance, or to parse what is said in earnest from what is meant facetiously. (Trump is particularly troublesome in this regard, as his most incendiary words are frequently explained away as humor lost on his uptight critics.) \n\nThe more difficult possibility is that the alleged shooter’s manifesto is truthful, and that there is no causal or suggestive link between his actions and Trump’s words. The Chicago riot of 1919 exists within a constellation of violence known as the Red Summer. Two dozen riots erupted in the summer and fall of that year, overwhelmingly targeting black people, particularly those who had migrated into urban areas in the North and the Midwest. In that pre-Internet age, there was no need for central coördination. In Elaine, Arkansas; Washington, D.C.; Omaha, Nebraska; Charleston, South Carolina; Wilmington, Delaware; Chicago, and elsewhere, mobs of whites, confronted with the possibility of black people gaining a share of the housing, employment, and democracy that they enjoyed, independently reached the same conclusion about the proper recourse. As the historian Linda Gordon points out in her book “[The Second Coming of the KKK](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Coming-KKK-Political-Tradition/dp/1631493698)*,*” the Klan, which had become moribund at the end of the nineteenth century, was resurrected during that time, adopting a broader set of hatreds, adding Jews and immigrants to its enemies list. Racial charlatans such as the lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant, who wrote “The Passing of the Great Race,” and the journalist Lothrop Stoddard, the author of “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy,” whipped up public fears that the white population was being subsumed in a tide of inferior bloodlines. Exclusionary, racist immigration laws were passed. And black people in cities were pursued and attacked, leaving an estimated two hundred and fifty fatalities. Invasions, after all, are to be met with overwhelming force. \n\nTrump declared his Presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, citing the presence of Mexican rapists as part of his rationale. A day later, [Dylann Roof](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/inside-the-trial-of-dylann-roof) killed nine black people in the basement of a church in Charleston, citing the threat of black rapists as his rationale. The former did not cause the latter—Roof, in fact, had been planning the attack for months. But Trump and Roof were responding to the same racial Zeitgeist, one in which the elevation of a black President meant that the value of whiteness had been correspondingly diminished. History, we’re told, repeats itself. But this phrasing has always troubled me, as if we are beholden to an inanimate application designed to produce similar situations again and again. A more precise assessment is that people respond in familiar ways to the same dynamics across time. There is no law mandating that our futures bear some familial resemblance to the worst of our present. Humans may learn from history. But we’ll invariably find ourselves locked in conflict with dangerous men intoxicated with their own sense of mission, and drunkenly believing that the only problem with the past is that we ever departed from it at all.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1ccee56e652c902746dd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Charleston Shooting","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"charleston-shooting"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c957a4e65be2f29d55262","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

It’s not a glamorous city—it built its prosperity on paper mills—but I’ve always felt at home there. My daughter was born in the Glens Falls Hospital; I researched parts of my first book in the stacks of its fine Crandall Public Library; it is “town” in this part of the world. But it’s not Vermont, where I now live most of the year, or Brooklyn, or San Francisco, or the other sorts of places where people are more likely to engage in civil protest. Warren County, which it anchors, is classic rural red: [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) territory in the 2016 election, and by a fairly sizable margin.\n\nSo, when friends told me that there’d be a protest in support of the immigrants being held in detention centers on the southern border, I wondered if anyone would show up. About seventy-five people were gathered in leafy City Park when I arrived, which seemed to me a good turnout, even if many of them had driven north half an hour from the considerably hipper city of Saratoga Springs. For an hour, people listened to earnest speeches—including one from a Skidmore professor recently back from Texas with grim tales of separated families—and to folk songs, and to a rabbi blowing a shofar with considerable vigor.\n\nAnd then we walked three or four blocks through the center of town, chanting, “No More Hate!,” until we were outside the office of Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican, who represents New York’s Twenty-first Congressional District. When we arrived, a crowd perhaps a third the size of our group was already in place, carrying Trump banners and chanting their own slogans: “Americans before illegals,” “Build the wall,” and “Four more years.” (One woman was holding a sign that just said “*CAPITALISM*{:.small},” and only because she was wearing a *MAGA*{:.small} hat could I be sure of her politics.) It was tense, especially since the local police—unaccustomed, I think, to this sort of thing—simply stood by and let the two sides face off. There was a certain amount of middle-fingering from the Trump contingent and tut-tutting from our side. Mostly, it was noisy, because the leader of the Trumpists had a bullhorn that he could (and did) set to siren mode, largely drowning out the earnest attempts to sing “This Land Is Your Land” and “America the Beautiful.” After a little while, our group decamped back to the park, and mostly dispersed.\n\nSix of us, however, went back to the Stefanik’s office and sat in the reception area, telling the pleasant receptionist that we were planning to stay until we could talk to the congresswoman—over the phone, or via Skype, or some such. She said she was phoning Washington, and then told us that Stefanik was unavailable, and then announced that the office was closed, and then that she was summoning the police, which was more or less what we’d guessed would happen. While we sat there waiting, I ate a number of butterscotch candies that had been put out in a bowl on a side table, and admired a map of the district, which runs from Saratoga to the Canadian border and west across the mountains to Lake Ontario. I know that country as well as I know any place on earth, and I love it more deeply than any other—it is the great wilderness of the East, bordered by cities, rivers, and farms, and set somewhat apart from the bustle of the rest of the world.\n\nA detective in a sports jacket soon arrived, and, after huddling with the receptionist and a nice young man spending a college summer as an intern, he told us that we would have to leave, or we would be put under arrest. “I don’t see why it would do you any good to be arrested,” he said, which, actually, was a reasonable point. I doubted that it would change anyone’s mind if we were carted away. And yet it seemed, somehow, like a necessary, if modest, gesture of solidarity with the people sitting for months on end in holding pens in the desert.\n\nFor me, immigration, in particular, has become a larger and more pressing issue over the years. That’s because I mostly work on the question of climate change, and it’s become very clear that [a rapidly heating planet is already driving many people to move](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/how-extreme-weather-is-shrinking-the-planet). In Central America, for instance, recent reporting has made it clear that drought and heat have made it [hard to grow food](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis) in the highlands of Honduras and Guatemala, starting many farmers on the journey that eventually takes them to the U.S. border. These people did not pour into the atmosphere the carbon that raised the temperature, causing their woe. (That was us.) And, as [this week’s report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/deforestation-agriculture-and-diet-are-fuelling-the-climate-crisis) from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) makes clear, there will be infinitely more of them as the century grinds hotly on. The U.N. estimates that we can expect somewhere between two hundred million and a billion climate refugees on the move around the world. We have to try to slow down that heating, of course, but we also have to come up with ways to help our fellow-humans endure this new world. Cages and walls—and ranting about “invasions”—are as ugly as they are pointless.\n\nAnd so the perfectly professional Glens Falls police officers cuffed us and took us to the station, where we were chained by the ankle and, eventually, processed and released, and told to return to court in a couple of weeks to answer to charges of criminal trespass in the third degree. A legal-aid lawyer said that the possible sentence was a term of three months, which I devoutly hope is not the case—a few hours was dreary enough. But it’s a good reminder that there are many people effectively sentenced to terms like that on the border—people who can’t find their children, people who have no real home to go back to. We can’t be like them, those of us who have options and resources and connections. But we can, in some small way, be with them.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border

As I usually do in a European city I haven’t visited before, I went to the local history museum to see how the story of the Second World War is presented. Stuttgart’s museum opened just last year, and its handling of the Nazi era is more circumspect than that of older German memorials. The period from 1933 to 1945 comprises a small set of displays, perhaps ten per cent of the entire exhibition. The tone is neutral.\n\n“After 1933, National Socialism pursued Hitler’s anti-Semitic, racist, and imperialistic ends in Shtuttgart, too,” a caption explains in English. “Despite their Social Democratic past, many citizens endorsed and profited from the new policies.” Only a third of Stuttgart’s residents voted for the Nationalist Socialists, but this was enough to make the party dominant in the city. “In 1933 began the marginalization, persecution, and murder of Jews, political opponents (social democrats and communists), and other groups,” another caption states, using an impersonal construction that makes marginalization, persecution, and murder sound like forces of nature rather than acts of man. Members of Hitler’s party defaced the entrances to Jewish shops and then rallied in the town square.\n\nOther captions rehearse a familiar chronology, but I found myself noticing things I hadn’t paid attention to before. The Nuremberg Laws, passed in the name of “protecting German blood and honor,” prohibited sexual relations and marriage between Jews and Aryans and stripped Jews of an array of rights, including the right to employ German women under the age of forty-five in Jewish homes.  The “marginalization, persecution, and murders” began in 1933, but the laws were passed two years later—by this time, many Germans had been convinced that they were necessary. But what jumped out at me was the age clause in the ban on Jewish domestic workers. It’s the kind of bureaucratic phrase that lends legitimacy to something abhorrent. After all, Jewish women past reproductive age were still allowed to be employed in German homes. In the same way, Russian authorities are forever pointing out that Russian law bans not all “homosexual propaganda” but only “homosexual propaganda to minors.” The Trump Administration presents its war on immigrants as a war on certain groups of immigrants only—only the asylum seekers who cross between points of entry, for example, or those who lied on their citizenship application. It’s the legalistic veneer of fascism.\n\nThere was a small display with three cut-crystal goblets. “Pogrom of November 9, 1938,” the caption said, using the Russian word in place of the more familiar Kristallnacht. “Victor Rosenfeld (1884-1966) was in Dachau after the pogrom but released a month later. In 1939, he emigrated. He gave his glassware to a neighbor.” This is the kind of story we never think about. Why was Rosenfeld released after a month in Dachau? How was he able to emigrate at that late date? How many people looked at him after his release and breathed a sigh of relief: Perhaps things weren’t so bad?\n\nAnother display informed me that the Second World War began in 1939 and that “Stuttgart underwent 52 air raids. About 4,600 residents lost their lives; 14,000 soldiers from Stuttgart died in the field.” I assume that neither figure includes Stuttgart Jews, who, according to one museum display, numbered forty-six hundred in 1933. I know from other sources that, while some of them managed to emigrate, a majority died at the hands of the Nazis. But they didn’t die here: they were transported to the ghetto and then the killing field in Riga or to concentration and then death camps elsewhere. By the time the war began, they had already been either physically removed or legally defined out of the city—so that, eighty years later, in de-Nazified Germany, Jews are not included in the death tally of the city where they lived. Once an absence has been created, a record is almost impossible to forge.\n\nLike anyone who grew up as an outsider—in my case, a Jew in the Soviet Union—I have always been aware of the shifting definitions of belonging. In the nineteen-nineties, when I returned to live in Russia after ten years in exile, the country had liberalized laws on documents, granting citizens the right to define their own ethnicity. When I applied for my new internal passport (the Soviet Union had stripped my family of citizenship in 1981 and restored it in 1992), I decided to test that rule. The internal passport still contained “ethnicity” as one of the essential characteristics, along with name, surname, date and place of birth, and gender. I asked that my ethnicity be indicated as “citizen of Russia.” I still remember the heavy middle-aged woman bureaucrat who looked at my documents, back at me, and back at my documents in confusion, and finally said, “But it says here that your father is Jewish and your mother was Jewish—what kind of citizen of Russia are you?”\n\nI have often told this anecdote, because it’s a perfect—and amusing—illustration of a disconnect between abstract definitions and visceral understanding. To the bureaucrat, the operative word in the phrase “Russian citizen” was “Russian,” and that, to her, referred exclusively to ethnic Russians. She was a kindly woman and she was even aware of the new law allowing people to self-define, but she couldn’t conceive of any definition of me that did not conform to her understanding of how ethnicity and belonging work.\n\nThe Russian bureaucrat’s barely articulated understanding is not that different from the understanding [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) has been expressing with his tweets, his statements at the White House, and the rally chant he incited about Representatives [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/alexandria-ocasio-cortez), Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and especially Ilhan Omar. He tweeted that the congresswomen should “go back” to “the places from which they came,” and his crowd chanted, of Omar, “Send her back,” because it is inconceivable to them that women of color, Muslim women, and especially a Muslim woman born outside this country could be citizens, and elected officials, of the United States.\n\nThis understanding is shared by Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway, who asked a reporter, “What’s your ethnicity?” A lot of things happened then. Conway identified herself as ethnically Italian and Irish. Media reports identified the reporter, Andrew Feinberg of Breakfast Media, as Jewish. Feinberg himself wrote an [op-ed](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/kellyanne-conway-racist-question-reporter-trump-white-house-twitter-a9008816.html) in which he identified his family as coming from a “mix of Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish and Russian stock.” I am pretty sure none of those countries would claim Feinberg’s relatives, who, to them, were Jews and therefore outsiders—like I was to that bureaucrat. On another level, Feinberg was trying to defend his right to be viewed as an American irrespective of his ethnic background (and in part because he is a journalist) while Conway was positioning herself as an American *because* of her background—because Italian and Irish are, at present, white-American categories (while journalists are the enemies of the people and Jews are, well, always suspect).\n\nThe categories of citizenship, ethnicity, and belonging are always in flux, hazy around the edges. If we have to have them at all—and I wish we didn’t, or at least consciously wanted to rid ourselves of them—then they should indeed be in flux. But this means that whoever screams the loudest can force and direct a drastic renegotiation.\n\nBizarrely, the Trump Administration is forcing a renegotiation of who is Jewish. In a recent [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/opinion/trump-ilhan-omar.html), the *Times* columnist Michelle Goldberg documents a pattern of non-Jews accusing Jews of anti-Semitism for, basically, failing to support Trump. The logic is perfectly circular: Trump and congressional Republicans are using the smear of anti-Semitism to attack Omar and Tlaib, which makes Trump’s opponents the enemies of the enemies of anti-Semitism, which makes them anti-Semites. (I know how this one goes. As a secular Jew and opponent of the Israeli policies in the Palestinian territories, I have been accused of anti-Semitism. I also regularly get messages telling me to go back to Russia—a country I had to leave in part because, like many other opponents of Vladimir Putin, I was accused of being unpatriotic and “Russophobic.”)\n\nBy turning unspoken assumptions into hateful rally chants, Trump is not merely destroying the norms of political speech but weaponizing them. He is cashing in on the easy trick of saying out loud what others barely dare to think. But his supporters are also enforcing the prohibition on his opponents’ taking part in the conversation—as when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was reprimanded for calling Trump’s speech “racist” on the House floor. Trump has initiated a radical renegotiation of belonging in this country and then monopolized it. This is what happens first: a political force seizes the power to define its members as insiders and certain others as intruders. This is done in the name of protection of the motherland, which the newly marginalized are said to hate. Everything else follows.\n\n*A previous version of this story incorrectly stated, based on the display at the Stuttgart museum, that the Nuremberg Laws prohibited Jewish women under the age of forty-five from being employed in a German home; in fact, German women under the age of forty-five were prohibited from being employed in Jewish homes.* ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d862bc86f2c9a244ac4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nazi Germany","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nazi-germany"},{"id":"5c2e1ccdb75f002c8941e4e9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"White Nationalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"white-nationalism"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Crisis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-crisis"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

But any future reversal of policy will do little to help kids who have already been detained—many of them after being separated from a parent or other relative. The psychological effects of separation and detention have worried experts in child development, and some of them are speaking out. The American Psychological Association, among other groups, has issued multiple statements on the effects of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies, writing that they “pose serious harm to the psychological well-being of immigrant children, their U.S.-born siblings, and other family members.”\n\nI recently spoke with Jack P. Shonkoff—a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a professor of child health and development at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Graduate School of Education—whose research has addressed the consequences of excessive stress on young children. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the psychological effects of detention, the differences in how toddlers and teen-agers register trauma, and why kids who appear to have adapted to their circumstances are often at risk of the most serious problems.\n\n__What most concerns you about what we have read about and seen from these border facilities holding children?__\n\nOh, God, where do I begin? I think—to cut through all of the noise, the politics, the back-and-forth on the details—there are just two core issues that are screaming out. One is the fact that the forced and abrupt separation of children from their parents is a huge psychological trauma and assault. The magnitude of the nature of the crisis for a child’s health and well-being cannot be overstated. Abrupt separation from primary caregivers or parents is a major psychological emergency. \n\nThe second issue is the prolonged placement of children in institutional settings. Obviously, the two are linked in this particular situation. From the perspective of what we know about children’s health and well-being, what we know about trauma, abrupt separation is one area where we have a lot of research and a lot of evidence about its consequences. But prolonged institutionalization is a separate area in which we have an equally deep research base and knowledge about how damaging that kind of setting is for kids. We are dealing with two very well-studied, serious assaults on the health and well-being of children.\n\n__Just to start with separation—and a lot of these kids have been separated from parents or relatives—what sort of case studies are you looking at? What historical examples are you looking at?__\n\nIt’s a very important question, because in some areas you have classic studies, some iconic investigations that demonstrate this issue. In this case, the importance of the primary relationship—the protective and stable and responsive nature of a parent-child relationship—is not something that comes from a handful of studies. This comes from decades of research across multiple areas. It is a fundamental concept that children, especially when they are young, depend upon stable, responsive relationships for healthy development. When you disrupt those relationships, you pull the rug out from under everything that supports emotional, social, physical well-being. It’s a core scientific principle. \n\n__What are the differences between how young kids and older kids respond to separation and what the consequences are?__\n\nObviously, the younger you are the more dependent you are on a stable adult relationship. So, for the toddlers, the preschoolers, the abrupt separation is devastating, not only in terms of what it looks like from the outside but in terms of what is going on inside the body. The healthy development of brain circuits depends upon what we call serve-and-return interaction. It means that healthy brain development requires responsive interaction, not just a passive receipt of stimulation. The child does something, and the adult responds. The adult does something, and the child responds. It’s the essence of what drives healthy brain development. And the brain is biologically wired to expect that kind of responsive interaction, and it uses it to build healthy brain circuits. When that kind of healthy interaction is absent, it triggers a massive stress response inside the body. The heart rate goes up; blood pressure goes up; stress-hormone levels go up; the immune system is activated. \n\nThe absence of responsive interaction is, to a young child, potentially life-threatening. Children can’t feed themselves; they can’t take care of themselves; they can’t do anything if they are in pain. So, biologically, you need the interaction from a responsive adult to promote healthy development, and the absence of it triggers this massive stress reaction, which ultimately leads to what we call toxic stress. It disrupts brain circuits, it disrupts the immune system, it disrupts metabolic systems, and it sets the stage for lifelong problems with physical health and mental health.\n\n__And for older kids, or teen-agers?__\n\nThe difference, on the one hand, is that most of these biological systems are now much more mature. The brain has already built its basic circuitry. So now this kind of trauma is managed differently, depending on its history. Kids who have had a reasonably good life—with caring relationships, strong brain architectures, strong immune systems—have more capacity to deal with this kind of a threat. Older kids who have had chronic adversity, who have experienced a lot of stress, are going to be more vulnerable. They have a lower threshold for being seriously disrupted and undermined by this. Older kids have more of a sense of self-agency, of autonomy, so they figure out how to begin to cope with that, as opposed to very young children, whose coping mechanics haven’t yet developed. \n\nFor older kids, rather than being completely overwhelmed, you are going to get a variety of responses, ranging from severe anxiety to depression to aggressive behavior to anger. All of them will vary. The youngest children are the most vulnerable to this massive disruption. For older kids, it is more of these behavioral responses. \n\n__Many of these kids who crossed the border were already separated from family, and may have seen real violence. You mentioned past history, and I would imagine a lot of them have had histories that would mean more severe consequences.__\n\nYeah, that is absolutely right. From a science point of view, the first organizing principle is that there is tremendous variability. You can’t generalize across the board for children. It will depend a lot on age, a lot on preëxisting trauma, on preëxisting illnesses, and differences in the way kids are wired and in their personalities. Some kids may have a much lower threshold to be seriously withdrawn and depressed, while others are more likely to become aggressive or overtly angry. These are all variations on the same theme, which is the body responding to a massive psychological assault.\n\n__To turn to detention, are there specific case studies or research you are drawing from?__ \n\nYes, absolutely. And especially for the younger kids. We have research going back more than half a century to look at the impact of institutionalization on child development. Most recently, studies were done on some of the [orphanages](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/power-touch) that were set up in Romania, where young children were given up by their parents early on, because the state banned birth control and poor people had no way they could manage. \n\nThe thing that people need to understand about institutionalization is that, if children are in these large institutional settings, where there are tens or hundreds or thousands of kids, the issue here is the lack of individualized attention, and lack of ability to form relationships with adults that can be responsive to them. For the younger kids, you can be in an institution that is clean, that provides adequate nutrition and appropriate hygiene and bathing, but the lack of stimulation, the lack of interaction, the inability to have relationships with a relatively small number of adults is devastating to development. That is what some of the early research showed. It is not about how clean they are and whether kids are fed. The very fact of being in an institutionalized setting that results in neglect has a devastating effect on development.\n\n__And we know, above and beyond, that a lot of them are not getting showers and are sleeping on cold floors.__\n\nThat’s exactly the point. When you get to the point of not providing basic nutrition, exercise, hygiene—first of all, you are smack in the middle of our legal definition of maltreatment and neglect, which is the largest part of the problem of our child-welfare system, even more than physical abuse. And there is a substantial amount of scientific research that shows that serious neglect in a family situation can be more harmful to children than physical abuse. And, when you take serious neglect and put it into an institutionalized setting, it is an overwhelming assault on children. Cleanliness and adequate food do not in any way make up for the fact that institutional settings are damaging to children’s mental and physical well-being.\n\n__Yes, and there have been reports of the Administration cutting funding for leisure activities and sports, which may strike people as cruel, which it is, but it seems like you are saying that it has an added dimension, which is that those activities are really important for kids.__\n\nYou are touching on a very important point, which is the issue of what common sense would tell us and what science can add as a deeper understanding. To put children in these kinds of circumstances, and deprive them of the basic ingredients of the lowest level of decent day-to-day existence, like being able to play, being able to get outside—you don’t have to be a scientist to look at that and say it is just cruel. \n\nWhat the science says to us is that whatever may appear on the outside is not revealing what is going on inside the body. So children who are deprived of these basic ingredients of reasonable day-to-day childhood, inside their bodies the activation of their stress-response system is through the roof. In the youngest kids, you are likely to see withdrawn behavior—kids crawl into themselves and just space out, and people have no idea what is going on inside. And, for the older kids, you can see a lot of acting-out behavior and aggression, or you can see anxiety or depression.\n\nBut, for all of them, at every age, inside the body you have this activation of the stress system, which is having biological disruptive effects—affecting brain development, affecting the cardiovascular system, affecting the immune system—that are laying the foundations for serious problems later in learning, in behavioral recognition, in mental health and physical health, post-traumatic stress disorder. All of these things are percolating inside the body. \n\nThis is the part that the public needs to understand, particularly for some of these kids who appear to be settling into the institutional settings. Initially, there is a lot of crying, a lot of acting out, there is a lot of hyperactive behavior. But then, over time, what you may see is these kids start to become less overtly agitated. A person who doesn’t understand development might say that we are past the tough time now, that these kids are settling in. Wrong. Wrong. What’s happening is that their overt behavior is looking less problematic, but internally the biological disruptions are actually ramping up, churning on. Unless you understand what’s going on inside the body, you can think these kids are adapting or settling in. In fact, this is where toxic stress is creating the foundations for lots of serious problems that will follow later.\n\n__That’s not a bad metaphor for all of this.__\n\nThis is not an example of adjusting to the situation. This is an example of the wear-and-tear effect of the stress-activation system inside the body that is leading to a much more serious and worrisome state. With the younger children, at the beginning you had reports on television of them crying and asking for their parents. It’s heartbreaking. It’s hard to imagine how anybody could tolerate making that happen. But what is more distressing is when those kids stop crying and stop acting out, and just kind of sit there looking off into space. Actually, we are seeing how things are getting worse for them. The absence of crying is ominous for those young children.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d672710c62d10815538","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Child Separations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"child-separations"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Crisis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-crisis"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc36cecf4019214261","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mental Health","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mental-health"}],"sections":[{"id":"5c66cf8d715e6a5a5a904371","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Q. & A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"q-and-a"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5fcdd6207318b5db81f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Isaac Chotiner is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*, where he is the principal contributor to [Q.&nbsp;&&nbsp;A.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a), a series of timely interviews with major public figures in politics, media, books, business, technology, and more.

Tombstone, in Arizona. Both are old mining towns near the U.S.-Mexico border. They came into existence in the eighteen-seventies, during the silver strike, but soon suffered the same fate as most of the other mining towns in the region: boom, depression, abandonment, and then a strange kind of afterlife.\n\nSome years ago, I spent a summer in the Southwest with my then husband, our daughter, and my two stepsons, and we visited both places. It was 2014, the [immigration crisis](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/border-crisis) was very much in the news—unaccompanied children from Central America were arriving at the border in unprecedented numbers, seeking asylum—and I was beginning to do research on the situation. My husband and I were obsessively meeting deadlines, and the kids were getting impatient with us, feeling that we had scammed them into a vacation with no vacation plan. So we looked online and found that Shakespeare and Tombstone offered family-friendly activities: stagecoaches, historamas, and Wild West reënactments.\n\nApparently, some of the biggest legends of the Wild West had passed through Shakespeare. Dangerous Dan had been there. Curly Bill, too. And Bean Belly Smith. To be honest, I had no idea who these men were. But, reading their names out loud to the kids, I showed enthusiasm. At least I had heard of [Billy the Kid](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/12/28/the-many-stories-of-billy-the-kid), who, it was claimed, had washed dishes at Shakespeare’s only hotel—the Stratford, on Avon Avenue—after escaping from jail in 1875.\n\nTombstone had a world-famous reënactment show, “The O.K. Corral,” which was staged four times a day. It had museums, theatres, and another form of entertainment: “While you are enjoying the festivities you can be hung or have someone hung by the Tombstone Vigilantes at the hanging scaffold.”\n\nWe took a vote. Two adults versus three offspring. Shakespeare was closer. Shakespeare was called Shakespeare. Shakespeare won.\n\nWhen we got there, it turned out that we hadn’t done our research well: the town was privately owned and open only by appointment, and only for guided tours. At some point, Shakespeare had ceased staging reënactments and had become a rehearsal space for reënactment groups from other parts of the country, a place to practice gunfights and hangings. Now it no longer served that role, either.\n\nSo we continued on to Tombstone, which, to our relief, was everything the kids could have hoped for. It was like walking onto the set of an old Western. The streets were lined with haunted brothels and restored saloons, little museums and souvenir shops. On corners, frugal cowboys smoked cigarettes down to the butt, and announced the next gunfight in loud, hoarse voices. Horse-drawn stagecoaches passed by, their mostly senior passengers gazing abstractly out the window toward an invisible but vivid past.\n\n“The O.K. Corral” re-created a dispute that led to a thirty-second shoot-out between outlaw cowboys (the Clanton brothers, the McLaury brothers, et al.) and Tombstone’s lawmen Doc Holliday and the brothers Virgil, Morgan, and Wyatt Earp, in the course of which lawlessness was defeated by lawfulness—or, at least, by a different kind of law.\n\nWhile the kids watched another reënactment, I waited outside. I wanted quiet and solitude. But horse-drawn carriages kept passing by, and a man dressed as a kind of harlequin-cowboy occupied a shady corner nearby and began singing country songs. I was asked for a light, and then a cigarette, and ended up smoking with a mildly depressed and very talkative Doc Holliday. At some point, he was greeted by another Doc Holliday, who also asked for a cigarette. The town, it seemed, existed not only in a loop of embodied repetitions of odd historical moments but also in a kind of cut-and-paste of the same people. It is entirely possible that, at any given moment in Tombstone, Wyatt Earp is having a beer with Wyatt Earp.\n\nWhat were these towns? Shakespeare, as we had seen, had never quite recovered from the post-boom depression, and was now a ghost of a ghost town. Tombstone had recovered, and was a tourist destination visited by almost half a million people a year, though in many ways it was also a ghost town, a kind of Hades, ruled by the law of eternal return. It was a space where the past had been replaced by a peculiar, repetitive, and selective representation of the past.\n\nBefore leaving, the kids insisted on having a family portrait taken—one of those kitsch, sepia, barrels-in-the-background, rifles, and hats kinds of portrait. We were given a menu of costumes to choose from. We could be Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp, or one of the Clantons—or an “Outlaw Mexican” or a “Native American.” We had our portrait taken, and that was that for our visit. But I was, of course, left with questions and thoughts about why some people get to have a name in history while others remain a generic category, why some identities are mapped into history and others are mapped out.\n\nI returned to Shakespeare and Tombstone again this year—with my friend Pejk Malinovski, a writer and audio documentarian with whom I’d collaborated before—looking for answers. Or maybe I was looking for better questions. Since my last trip to Arizona, the national fixation on “the border crisis” had reached a fever pitch, and the treatment of undocumented migrants at the border had hit record lows. It was a good moment to return to these places which, although they are near the U.S.-Mexico border and along the most common migration corridors in the U.S., seemed, at least at first glance, oblivious both of history and of the current political reality.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIt’s late April, and Pejk and I meet in Tucson. We visit two local friends, Francisco Cantú and Karima Walker, to get their perspective on the towns by the border and on immigration. (Cantú worked for some years for the U.S. Border Patrol, and later wrote a book about the experience, called “[The Line Becomes a River](https://www.amazon.com/Line-Becomes-River-Dispatches-Border/dp/0735217734).”) Walker asks if we’re going to interview Chris Simcox, who was a founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, a Tombstone-based civilian border militia group. After working as a reënactor in one of the gunfights performed in Tombstone, Simcox bought and began editing the now defunct Tombstone _Tumbleweed_. And, in 2002, using the newspaper as his platform, he issued a call to arms, inviting volunteers to take part in a new citizens’ border militia: “Join together and protect your country in a time of war!” The M.C.D.C., which was connected to the deaths of multiple migrants, disbanded in 2010, but Walker’s question reinforces my sense that there may be a connection between these places which glorify and commodify a violent frontier past and the violence that is so frequently directed toward undocumented immigrants in the area. That night, I Google Simcox and discover that he is now in prison, for reasons unrelated to his Minuteman activities. (He was found guilty of child molestation in 2016 and is serving a nineteen-year sentence.)\n\nVigilante and civilian patrol groups like the M.C.D.C. have existed for as long as the frontier has existed; the difference is that the perceived enemy is no longer Native Americans but undocumented immigrants, most of whom are also, by the way, indigenous Americans (from America the continent). Indeed, the nineteenth-century narrative of the “savage Indian” is not so different from that of the “illegal immigrant” today. Most of the current discourse that condemns immigration across the southern border, from the White House on down, has to do with the supposed savagery, criminality, and illegality of the “invaders.” The M.C.D.C. no longer exists, but there are other groups. Most of them have Facebook and Web pages, some of which you need to be approved for before joining. In Arizona, there is Arizona Border Recon. In New Mexico, there’s the United Constitutional Patriots, founded in 2014 and led by Larry Mitchell Hopkins, who also goes by Johnny Horton, Jr. Videos posted on the Facebook page of the U.C.P.’s spokesman, Jim Benvie, show civilian militiamen in military-style uniforms driving down dark roads at night, following and then detaining migrants, and forcing them to sit or kneel on the ground to await the arrival of Border Patrol agents. Two weeks before our trip, the group posted a live video showing its members detaining two hundred migrants, among them children, at gunpoint. Hopkins was arrested and charged with illegal weapons possession soon afterward, and, in early May, after Paypal and GoFundMe shut down the group’s donations page, the U.C.P. rebranded itself as Guardian Patriots.\n\nThe next morning, Pejk, Cantú, and I head for Tombstone. I’ve been reading a book titled “[Tombstone’s Most Haunted](https://www.amazon.com/Tombstones-Most-Haunted-Joshua-Hawley/dp/1980844976),” by Joshua Hawley, who is the director of reënactments at the O.K. Corral, and also the director of Tombstone’s paranormal investigations. In the book, Hawley lists the instruments that ghost hunters commonly use: “Video cameras with infrared night vision, still cameras, analog and digital audio recorders, motion detectors, and thermal-imaging cameras.” Cantú tells us that most of the same equipment is used by the Border Patrol (and probably also by civilian militias) to detect border crossers. He views this as another manifestation of the way in which migrants are dehumanized, seen as ghosts—or as targets in a high-tech video game.\n\nAs we distance ourselves from Tucson, the desert stretches endlessly before us, the saguaros, creosote, and mesquite becoming more frequent. Soon, the soft undulations of the hills are interrupted by the jagged peaks of the Dragoon Mountains, their contours sharp in the clear morning light. As we park in Tombstone, we notice a young man in nineteenth-century cowboy gear walking toward us. Spaghetti-bodied, he moves with a joyful kind of skip. He’s on his way to work at the O.K. Corral, it turns out, and the first show of the day starts in less than an hour. He tells us that he’s originally from Connecticut but now lives in Tombstone. Today, he’s playing the outlaw Frank McLaury, and when we ask him if he likes his job he furrows his brow, looks romantically toward the horizon, then back at us, and says, “Well, there’s nothin’ quite like getting to shoot guns at your friends all day, and then getting up and going to have a beer when you’re done.” He also sees it as a stepping stone toward some other acting job, maybe in the film industry, and, as he says this, his mouth opens in a wide, boyish smile. When we ask him what he doesn’t like about his job, he points to his gun and says that working with real guns onstage can be a safety hazard. He smiles again, but, with his hand on his gun, his boyishness seems a little less endearing.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5cf04e384cad85f237c7d9d2]||||||\n+++\n\nHe is the first person we talk to, and the first to readily show us his gun. Everyone else we talk to in the days that follow will do the same, always unprompted, at some point in our conversation. Outside the O.K. Corral, a monumental Virgil Earp with a full, graying mustache and a degree in history talks to us about his fascination with the Old West—and then shows us his guns. The cowboy Billy Claiborne tells us about his acting career, and then shows us his gun. A Wyatt Earp (or maybe it was a Morgan) follows suit. And then an Ike Clanton tells us that, in addition to acting in “The O.K. Corral,” he’s in charge of “making the ammo”—blanks—for all the reënactors: “You clean the shells, we use .45 shells, prime them, pack them with gun powder and vermiculite, to keep the powder inside the shell . . . and make it _boom_.”\n\n“Boom?” I say.\n\n“Yeah, _boom_! ”\n\nGoing to Tombstone can feel like stepping into someone’s psychotic episode—one fuelled by testosterone and paranoia. At the same time, it’s clear that the O.K. Corral reënactors are just actors, people trying to pay the bills, or kind of; when I was in Tombstone the first time, the two Doc Hollidays I talked to told me that the pay was so bad that another Doc Holliday spent half the year being Mickey Mouse at Disneyland to supplement it.\n\nI want to talk to a reënactor who plays Big Nose Kate, who was at some point married to Doc Holliday and supposedly witnessed the gunfight from the boarding house next door. But there are no Kates to be seen. When I ask the elderly woman who sells T-shirts in the shop next to the O.K. Corral why she thinks women are mostly absent from the reënactment scene, she tells me that women do appear, but only on special weekends, and explains that, in the Old West, “women were either housewives or prostitutes. Not visible.”\n\nI also ask her about one of the T-shirts on display. It has a picture of two guns, with the caption “The Original Homeland Security.” She looks at me with a smile and says, “Well, guns!”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe show is about to start, so we step into the O.K. Corral and find seats in the metal bleachers, among twenty or thirty spectators. The show itself goes over my head—Clantons, Earps, Clantons, Earps—but every single one of the many gunshots in the short performance makes me jump. Perhaps because I didn’t grow up in the U.S., Wild West reënactments evoke no nostalgia in me. When I ask American friends what they know about the reënactment world, most mumble something about the Civil War. Some were dragged as kids to a reënactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, which for the past twenty-five years has taken place annually at the site where the real battles were fought. Few people I come across know that there are more than fifty thousand Civil War reënactors in the country, members of a guild with strict hierarchies and distinctions. Tony Horwitz, in his book “[Confederates in the Attic](https://www.amazon.com/Confederates-Attic-Dispatches-Unfinished-Civil/dp/067975833X),” analyzes what he calls “a period rush,” the particular adrenaline-fuelled energy that comes with being fully immersed in an authentic re-creation. Authenticity is the yardstick in reënactment culture. A “farb” is a reënactor who doesn’t spend enough time or money on props and costumes. The most committed call themselves “living historians,” and the “hard-cores” among them sometimes go on spartanlike diets in order to resemble underfed nineteenth-century soldiers; others soak the buttons that they sew on their uniforms in urine, to generate just the right amount of rust.\n\nTowns like Tombstone began staging reënactments in the late nineteen-twenties. Military forts around the country were being converted into tourist attractions, landmarks commemorating wars and battles dotted the landscape, and some ghost towns were repurposed as life-size stages. America was mythologizing, via tourism and pop culture, its still recent past, and there was plenty of material to work with. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, nickelodeons and dime novels had featured the “lawless towns” of the West, and stories of cowboys, saloons, gunfights, and outlaws had become part of the collective imagination. Then came television and Hollywood, to further consolidate the myths of the Wild West.\n\nFrontier towns, the mining booms decades behind them, had to choose between extinction and transforming themselves into caricatures of their glory days for public consumption. Adapting involved mapping that collective imagination back into real space, capitalizing on and commodifying the myths—along with whatever deep currents those myths activated in people. In 1929, a group of residents in Tombstone, which was approaching its fiftieth anniversary and already almost a ghost town, decided to organize a celebration of the town’s heritage, with reënactments of its epic moments. They called it the Helldorado. A success, it was repeated for a few subsequent years, and then revived, by a group called the Tombstone Vigilantes, after the Second World War; in the nineteen-fifties, the group established year-round shows celebrating the town’s frontier days.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFrom the O.K. Corral, we wander into a cluttered, dark store, where books, magazines, and files are stacked in columns. In a corner of the shop, we find an old man with a snowy mustache and some strands of white hair, combed and gelled back. He is Ben Traywick, the ninety-one-year-old, now retired official historian of Tombstone. He was born in Tennessee and worked in nuclear fission, before being transferred to a missile project, Polaris, in California. He later owned an explosives factory near Tombstone, where he relocated in the sixties.\n\nTraywick is full of stories, a kind of Wizard of Oz of Tombstone, and the author of countless reënactment skits. He wrote the original O.K. Corral scene (and played Wyatt Earp for twenty years).\n\nI ask him what he thinks draws so many people to the Tombstone reënactments.\n\n“When I came here, in 1968, I saw that Tombstone was not being advertised,” he says. “That’s the key, right there, advertisement. So I wrote a script for all those big acts that happened here. We decided to do historical acts that really happened. We were very careful to have proper costumes, proper attitudes. . . . We re-created history. . . . Nobody got it right till I came along!”\n\nAn interesting paradox of the reënactment scene’s obsession with authenticity and historical accuracy, this “getting it right,” is that accuracy is measured in terms of the minute details of a particular event, which does not necessarily amount to historical accuracy in the broader sense. Old West history buffs may endlessly dispute whether Wyatt Earp was wearing a specific kind of bow tie during the O.K. Corral shoot-out in 1881, but may be oblivious of much of what was happening in the region during those years.\n\nWhen the original shoot-out at the O.K. Corral took place, one of the U.S.’s genocidal campaigns against Native Americans, known more widely and conveniently as the Apache Wars, was under way. Chief Cochise died in 1874, but Geronimo defended the Apacheria until 1886, before being driven, with thirty of his people, onto the Fort Sill Reservation, in Oklahoma. By 1848, Mexico had lost California, Nevada, Utah, and parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming, after a war that is known here as the Mexican War and in Mexico, more objectively but somehow also more courteously, as the United States Intervention. Then, in 1853, in a maneuver to insure the construction of the Pacific Railroad, the southern portion of a transcontinental railroad, the U.S. negotiated the Gadsden Purchase, and Mexico lost southern Arizona and southern New Mexico. Tombstone lies within that portion of the country, and in the eighteen-eighties there were still many Mexicans living there. In 1882, according to a framed document in Traywick’s bookstore, there were four hundred Mexicans and twenty-eight hundred Americans living in Tombstone. Native Americans were (and are, of course) also present in the region, as were small numbers of African-Americans and Asians. When I went to Tombstone for the first time, with my family—all of us born in Mexico—we quickly noticed that there were no Mexicans being portrayed in the reënactments. No Native Americans, either. Non-whites seemed to have been completely erased from the popular narratives.\n\nI ask Traywick why Mexicans and Native Americans don’t appear, even as enemies or adversaries, in borderland reënactments.\n\nHe stumbles a little, searching for the right words: “Mexicans were an accepted part of the problem here. They were part of the population here. Part of the civilization we had here.”\n\n“Yes, but you know how we have Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp, the Clantons—are there any reënactments in town where there is a Mexican character?”\n\n“Well, we had Mexican characters in our show.”\n\n“Like who?”\n\n“Hard to say. You have to take them as a whole. They were in our group.”\n\n“Can you remember any Mexican characters?”\n\n“Well, there was a Mexican here in town. He cooked the best beef in the world.”\n\nTraywick tells Pejk and Cantú a long story about beheadings in China and shows them pictures of decapitated men, while I browse in the bookstore. There’s a Confederate flag in the back, some Mayan masks and relics behind Traywick’s desk, a few dusty mariachi hats, many framed pictures of admirals and generals—among them Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—and a poster of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) dressed as a cowboy, with a gun under his belt, and the slogan “Keeping America Safe Again.”\n\nI ask Traywick his opinion on current border issues.\n\n“Let me tell you something I would like to see, and that will answer your question,” he says. “I think that the U.S. made a big mistake. When they had Santa Anna, and had a chance to, they should have annexed Mexico. That would solidify the whole continent of North America.”\n\n“Including Central America?”\n\n“Yeah, get them, too!”\n\n“That said, do you think there should be a wall between Mexico and the U.S.?”\n\n“Yeah, I do, I do, because we have gotten so many criminals, and so many people with diseases. We need to protect ourselves. We still oughta take immigrants, but we oughta be choosy about taking them. Not take the people that have *aids*{: .small}, and whatever.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cf04e38e7649472415b90e4]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nWhen we ask if there are many undocumented immigrants in Tombstone, he says, “When people come to town, illegals, they leave quickly. . . . They know that everybody here owns a gun. No trouble.”\n\nAnd yet Traywick denies that there is any connection between Tombstone’s obsession with nineteenth-century vigilante justice and the civilian militia groups currently in the area. That is, he sees no connection between reënactments that celebrate hangings and gunfights as the “original homeland security” and contemporary forms of extrajudicial justice in which civilians deputize themselves to perform the tasks normally reserved for law enforcement.\n\nI ask Traywick if he’s familiar with Chris Simcox and the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. “He had nothing to do with the rest of the people. That was his own project,” he replies starkly. “Well, when he started that it looked like a good thing, but he let it take over his life. It got all out of bounds. I think he finally went to jail, didn’t he?”\n\nI wonder what Traywick means by “he let it take over his life”—what that “it” means. Hatred? Guns? Vigilante justice? According to an article published by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2006, Simcox was arrested in 2003 for illegally carrying a semi-automatic weapon in a national park along the border: “Also in Simcox’s possession at the time of that arrest . . . were a document entitled ‘Mission Plan,’ a police scanner, two walkie-talkies, and a toy figure of Wyatt Earp on horseback.” It seems plausible that, just as fictions about the Wild West have spilled over into real spaces like Tombstone, the fiction, repeated endlessly in reënactments, could somehow spill back into reality, be performed back into existence.\n\nBefore we say goodbye to Traywick, he takes us to the back of his shop and pulls out a long, curved black metal sword. He holds it up, looking proud and solemn, like a boy showing off his “Star Wars” lightsabre. He tells us that he had it shipped from China. “It’s a beheading sword!” he says.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn our way to an appointment with Dave Ochsenbine, the owner of Shakespeare, I read an advisory on the town’s Web page: “There is an abundance of rattle snakes, animals, mine borings and shafts that can cause you injury or death. There is also the current danger of drug mules walking from the Southern Border into the Lordsburg area. You do not want to come across or stop any person walking on the range.” “Drug mules” are one of the first things I bring up with Rod Linkous, a cowboy reënactor from El Paso, who gives us a tour of Shakespeare. He says that there is, indeed, evidence of drug mules passing through town, especially down by the arroyo, where they leave tracks.\n\n“But they could just be people migrating, right?”\n\n“There’s both: the coyotes and the mules.”\n\nHe doesn’t acknowledge the idea of “people,” just repeats the words “coyotes” and “mules,” terms that fit in well with the other creatures on the Shakespeare advisory list—rattlesnakes and animals. I ask Linkous if there are also civilian militias in the area. He says that they are definitely out here, too, but, he adds, “they’ve been kicked out because of . . . politics, basically. But they never threaten anybody. All they can do, under U.S. law, is effect a citizen’s arrest, detain illegals until the Border Patrol gets there. They’re doing the job. I figured it out one day: any one day there’s four thousand Border Patrol agents to cover six thousand miles of territory, Canadian and Mexican borders. That’s not a whole lot. So I can see the militia trying to help in some way.”\n\nShakespeare consists of nine or ten abandoned buildings, two inhabitants, and a spindly aluminum windmill. Our visit doesn’t last long, but Linkous is well versed in history, and we discuss the murky distinction between lawfulness and lawlessness in the nineteenth century. We’re talking about the history of vigilante groups in the Southwest when Ochsenbine joins us. His father-in-law’s family, the Hills, bought the abandoned town in 1935, and he and his wife, Gina, moved here from Ohio, just last year. They plan to do everything they can to keep the place alive and to preserve its history. He tells us about the Shakespeare Guard, which was formed in 1879, by a group of about seventy men, to protect the town from Apaches (the original inhabitants of the land).\n\nWhen we ask the two men what they like about nineteenth-century history, Linkous explains, “Well, there’s people moving West, fighting Indians, the Mexicans, the elements themselves, and somehow producing the country that we have today.”\n\n“Aren’t people who are coming here now the same as those independent settlers who were simply looking for a better life?” I ask.\n\nOchsenbine answers, “Whether they’re coming from Central America or China, they’re looking for a better life. I get that. But there’s a right way to go about it and a wrong way to go about it. And just coming over the border illegally is the wrong way.”\n\nThe mythos of the Wild West celebrates the spirit of those who sought to settle in a new land, domesticate its difficulties, and thrive. Why, I ask, is that spirit admired in some cases and condemned in others? Our Shakespeare guides protest that I’m conflating two different things. One case is “historical” and the other is . . . not.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nDriving south, toward the border, we see no signs of crisis, no migrants, and few cars. We see a Border Patrol cam truck—a pickup with a surveillance camera mounted on a tall mast—and many commercial trucks, probably transporting commodities in and out of the country. The great paradox of the *nafta*{: .small} agreement is that it has allowed for freer trade of merchandise across the border, and less freedom of movement for people.\n\nIn Douglas, Arizona, we reach the wall—or part of the wall that was constructed during the Obama Administration. There are two walls, in fact—one painted creamy white, on the American side; the other copper-colored, on the Mexican side—with a strip of land the width of about ten long strides between the two. Being there makes me feel slightly nauseated—as though my body wanted to cry, but from the belly, not the chest.\n\nWe drive west along the wall until we see a sign for an R.V. park called Twin Buttes, and decide to go in. When we knock on the door of the main office, a woman in her sixties named Beverly greets us with a neighborly smile. Pejk tells her, holding his microphone in her direction, that we are there to talk about immigration, and she says, “I can, but maybe my husband might like to talk to you, too. Oh, we know a lot about the border.” She tells us that her husband is just around the back, with some other R.V. residents. “It’s happy hour!” she adds.\n\nOut back, there are four men and one woman sitting at a long wooden picnic table, sipping beers. They look a little surprised as we approach. Beverly’s husband, Roger Kercher, greets us, and when he hears our accents he says, “You guys aren’t from America.”\n\nPejk says that he’s originally Danish but is now a U.S. citizen, and Roger replies, “O.K., the accent, I recognized it right off!”\n\nHe laughs with an expansive roar. He’s obviously the alpha man of the bunch, and he’s happy to talk at length about his views on the southern border. Between 2002 and 2008, before Obama put up this section of the wall, he tells us, he and Beverly sometimes had twenty people at their front door at two in the morning, looking for help, water, food.\n\nBeverly chimes in, “And especially for a ride to Phoenix—everybody wanted a ride to Phoenix.”\n\n“What would you do?” I ask.\n\n“Well, we would call the Border Patrol!” Roger answers. “And then we, well, _she_ would give them water, bananas, bread, peanut butter, ’cause there’d be all sorts of little kids.”\n\nSince the wall went up, he says, they mostly “get” young people, fewer kids, fewer old people. He refers to the men as “males.” He adds that all the twenty-one-year-olds who come are carrying fifty pounds of drugs on their back, and have a sniper with them. So, if you see “illegals with backpacks,” you have to ignore them: “Because someone is watching you, watching them.”\n\nHe tells a story about a Guatemalan who recently showed up, asking for a cell-phone charger and a ride to Phoenix, and boasts that he himself sent the man back to Mexico. It was the fourth time that the man had been deported. He points to one of the trailers in the park and says, “I have a Border Patrol agent who lives in that trailer, and a very good friend that’s a customs agent.” His Border Patrol friend tells him that, these days, there are Guatemalans, Chinese, and Cubans, and that “everybody is coming over now because they know they can sneak over with the other illegals.”\n\nOne of the men at the table, who has been silent until now, finishes his sentence: “And be released!”\n\nThe others, in a chorus, repeat, “And be released!”\n\nThe rule in the R.V. park, they say, is “You see one, you call one,” meaning that you call Border Patrol. When we ask Roger if he belongs to a civilian patrol group, he chuckles, and says not formally, but he surely drives out to the desert to help and support his fellow-patriots.\n\nThe main complaint in the R.V. park is that “illegals” cost money. That they are given free services everywhere, in the E.R. and in Social Security offices, where they ask for pensions, and that Americans have to pay for this. (This is, of course, not the reality of an undocumented immigrant.) Roger says that part of the problem is “bleeding-heart societies,” like the Catholic Charities, that have become an “incentive” for migrants. He suggests that all the illegals should just go to Minnesota. The others smile.\n\nPejk asks them what the solution might be.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5cf04e38e76494233a5b90e3]||||||\n+++\n\nRoger turns to him and holds his hand as if it were a pistol, aimed at Pejk’s chest. “I can’t shoot you, unless you’re robbing me, because then I broke the law, it’s illegal to shoot you,” he says. “But you can’t come into somebody’s country without legal documentation.”\n\n“What would your solution be?”\n\n“First off is, I’d go ahead and put the wall up, because it does regulate the young people and the old people, and vehicles.”\n\n“So a solid wall, all the way?”\n\n“Would be a good start,” Roger says, but he has more ideas: “Like the Guatemalan guy I sent back the fourth time, he’s gotta go to prison, and he’s gonna spend some time. . . . All right, well, let’s put ’em on a chain gang and let ’em cut the road ditches, and teach ’em a lesson!”\n\nThe R.V. park has thirty R.V. stations, a recreational area, and marked walking paths. Roger heads off down one of them, but says he’ll be back and instructs us to wait for him. The sky above is vast and cloudless.\n\nWhen Roger returns, he is driving a golf cart. It has a blue siren light stuck to the top and a bumper sticker that says “Tombstone, Arizona: Justice Is Coming.” As he steps out of the golf cart, he explains that the other residents say he’s like the sheriff around there, so, as a joke, they gave him the siren light and the bumper sticker. As we thank him for his time and begin to say goodbye, he reaches into the glove box of the golf cart and says, “By the way, wait, just to show you what the truth is . . .” He takes out a pistol. “I never leave home without one! We live in a dangerous area. One in my car, one in my golf cart.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\n“Are you folks ready for a gunfight?”\n\n“Yeah!” we answer.\n\nFiring his gun into the air, Doc Holliday repeats, “I said, Are you folks ready for a gunfight?”\n\n“Yeah!” we say again.\n\n“All right! Now, before we get started, I do have to talk to you about a couple of things. First things first, these are not toys—these are real firearms.”\n\nHe aims at a soda can and fires. The can explodes.\n\nWe all go, “Ahhhh!”\n\nAnd then there’s another gunshot, and the O.K. Corral reënactment officially begins.\n\nThe history of frontier towns like Shakespeare and Tombstone is one in which primarily white populations moved West, claiming territory and forcibly ejecting or killing those who were already there, then defending that territory against “invaders,” who were often the previous inhabitants—that is, Native Americans and, later, Mexicans—and, finally, establishing law. This last stage of frontier history is what is most often mined for reënactments: a Manichean representation of good (white) lawmen vs. bad (white) cowboys, which is ultimately a celebration of the founding of white America. The rest—the part about killing or banishing non-white others in order to defend claimed land—is conveniently elided. But the practice lives on, in a kind of reënactment with very real consequences, in which the protagonists are civilian border patrollers—people who feel they have a right to do whatever they can to keep others, and especially non-white others, out of this land. This vigilantism rests on the myth of the frontier, or on the idea of a place at the very edge of civilization that needs to be conquered and tamed and then guarded—with guns or with walls—against potential invaders, or _bandidos_. Like two mirrors facing each other, Wild West reënactments and the myths that fuel them shed light on the emotions driving the response to “the border crisis,” and, conversely, thinking about civilian border militias unveils some of the myths behind reënactment culture. The knot of intuitions I came with on this trip is finally unravelling. But, of course, there are new questions.\n\nThere are many ways of engaging politically with the world, of interacting with and establishing an emotional and intellectual connection with the communities to which we belong, as well as with communities that we don’t recognize as our own. There are rallies, classrooms, social networks, publishing spaces, sweat lodges, churches, bars, theatres, dinner parties. There are reënactments. But we’re living in a time when most forms of political engagement seem highly curated, cut sharply around the edges so as to include only that and those with whom we have a perceived affinity. I returned to Tombstone and Shakespeare in an effort to change the angle from which I approach immigration issues, to step outside my usual dynamics. In effect, I wanted to reënact my own past, in a different persona. I returned to the borderlands to look hatred in the face. But what I saw was not quite hatred. It was something more hollow, circular, repetitive. Something more like a reënactment of hate. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a reënactment observed by the author's

It had just endured eight days of arson and violence, which had claimed the lives of thirty-eight people—fifteen of them white, twenty-three of them black—including John Simpson, the sole police officer killed during the unrest. More than five hundred people were injured. Ostensibly, the violence began when Eugene Williams, a seventeen-year-old African-American, went swimming and rafting with his friends on Lake Michigan and drifted toward a part of the beach used only by whites. A white man named George Stauber began hurling stones at Williams, who eventually slipped beneath the water and drowned. Racial skirmishes broke out along the beach and spread across the city, lighting kindling that had been laid throughout the previous year. Thousands of black soldiers returning from the First World War competed against white workers for employment and housing. The veterans brought with them a renewed intolerance for discrimination, an attitude summarized in an editorial by W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du&nbsp;Bois in the magazine *The Crisis*. “By the God of Heaven,” Du&nbsp;Bois wrote, “we are cowards and jackasses if now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.” Other African-Americans, newly arrived migrants from the South, as part of what became known as the Great Migration, were viewed as interlopers whose willingness to work for low pay undercut the wages of white men. As the poet Eve Ewing notes in her searing collection “[1919](https://www.amazon.com/1919-Eve-L-Ewing/dp/1608466027),” white Chicagoans attributed the violence to a “Negro invasion” of previously white enclaves. The world had been made safe for democracy; Chicago had not. \n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d499b1ae9367a0009f6a95b]||||||\n+++\n\nThis past Saturday, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project held events across the city, including a bike tour and panel discussions, to memorialize the dead and to detail the legacy of that week of chaos and terror. The same day, fifteen hundred miles to the south, in [El Paso, Texas](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/trump-the-accomplice-el-paso-residents-blame-the-president-for-a-hate-fuelled-mass-shooting), there was a different commemoration taking place, one more akin to a dramatic reënactment than a sombre reflection—the past climbing out from its shallow grave to place its claim on the present. Twenty-two people died at the hands of a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle and [a list of grievances](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-virality-of-evil) yellowed by a century of repetition. A manifesto believed to be written by the shooter cites the “Hispanic invasion of Texas”—a contortion of history if ever there was one—as a motive for the murders. Another section of that document offers a disclaimer meant to indemnify [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump). “My ideology has not changed for several years,” it states. “My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president.” This is notable, in the sense that unsolicited denials often sound like direct admissions. In the past month, Trump has urged four sitting members of Congress—Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib—all women of color, to [“go back” to where they came from](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/donald-trumps-idea-of-selective-citizenship), and attacked a fifth representative, Elijah Cummings, an African-American, [by claiming](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-elijah-cummings-and-the-definition-of-a-rodent) that his district is “disgusting,” rat-infested, and beneath human habitability. Trump followed that with a tweet appearing to jeer when Cummings reported that his home had been burglarized. The language of the alleged El Paso shooter’s screed bears resemblance to Trump’s rhetoric, particularly in the martial description of undocumented people as an “invasion.” If the immediate conversation in the aftermath of El Paso—and the massacre of nine people [thirteen hours later, in Dayton, Ohio](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence)—has tended toward the accessibility of weapons of war in civilian life, the word “invasion” becomes even more telling. We are not, the killers seem to be telling us, living in peacetime. An AK-47 is a tool created to address enemy invasions. \n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn remarks delivered at the White House on Monday, Trump explicitly denounced white supremacy, just as he eventually did after first praising the “very fine people” at the “Unite the Right” [rally in Charlottesville](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-battle-of-charlottesville), two years ago this weekend. (He reverted to form a few months later by referring to Haiti and African countries as “shitholes.”) Just as he criticized people who chanted, about Ilhan Omar, “Send her back!,” at a rally three weeks ago. (He followed that by reversing that criticism and launching more racist tweets a week later.) Trump’s mindless belligerence, his perilous and ignorant world view, and, particularly, his use of inflammatory racist rhetoric are rightly seen as alarming. The Presidency is the most esteemed and powerful platform in the country, and it is reasonable to see a relationship between the President’s imprimatur and the ballistic bedlam that regularly erupts and targets people and groups for whom he has expressed contempt. Cesar Sayoc, who on Monday was sentenced to twenty years in prison for sending sixteen homemade pipe bombs to people whom he deemed enemies of the President, argued that his perspective was skewed by mental illness—and also by his obsessive admiration of Trump. This, for the record, is why people in public life are supposed to be mindful of their rhetoric. Their words reach a wide swath of the public, which has varying abilities to interpret their meaning and their nuance, or to parse what is said in earnest from what is meant facetiously. (Trump is particularly troublesome in this regard, as his most incendiary words are frequently explained away as humor lost on his uptight critics.) \n\nThe more difficult possibility is that the alleged shooter’s manifesto is truthful, and that there is no causal or suggestive link between his actions and Trump’s words. The Chicago riot of 1919 exists within a constellation of violence known as the Red Summer. Two dozen riots erupted in the summer and fall of that year, overwhelmingly targeting black people, particularly those who had migrated into urban areas in the North and the Midwest. In that pre-Internet age, there was no need for central coördination. In Elaine, Arkansas; Washington, D.C.; Omaha, Nebraska; Charleston, South Carolina; Wilmington, Delaware; Chicago, and elsewhere, mobs of whites, confronted with the possibility of black people gaining a share of the housing, employment, and democracy that they enjoyed, independently reached the same conclusion about the proper recourse. As the historian Linda Gordon points out in her book “[The Second Coming of the KKK](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Coming-KKK-Political-Tradition/dp/1631493698)*,*” the Klan, which had become moribund at the end of the nineteenth century, was resurrected during that time, adopting a broader set of hatreds, adding Jews and immigrants to its enemies list. Racial charlatans such as the lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant, who wrote “The Passing of the Great Race,” and the journalist Lothrop Stoddard, the author of “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy,” whipped up public fears that the white population was being subsumed in a tide of inferior bloodlines. Exclusionary, racist immigration laws were passed. And black people in cities were pursued and attacked, leaving an estimated two hundred and fifty fatalities. Invasions, after all, are to be met with overwhelming force. \n\nTrump declared his Presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, citing the presence of Mexican rapists as part of his rationale. A day later, [Dylann Roof](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/inside-the-trial-of-dylann-roof) killed nine black people in the basement of a church in Charleston, citing the threat of black rapists as his rationale. The former did not cause the latter—Roof, in fact, had been planning the attack for months. But Trump and Roof were responding to the same racial Zeitgeist, one in which the elevation of a black President meant that the value of whiteness had been correspondingly diminished. History, we’re told, repeats itself. But this phrasing has always troubled me, as if we are beholden to an inanimate application designed to produce similar situations again and again. A more precise assessment is that people respond in familiar ways to the same dynamics across time. There is no law mandating that our futures bear some familial resemblance to the worst of our present. Humans may learn from history. But we’ll invariably find ourselves locked in conflict with dangerous men intoxicated with their own sense of mission, and drunkenly believing that the only problem with the past is that we ever departed from it at all.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Guns","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass

on Saturday, an unsigned document was posted to 8chan, a site that calls itself “the darkest reaches of the Internet.” Its author appeared to be a twenty-one-year-old white man from near Dallas, Texas, who had just driven about nine hours to the border city of El Paso. According to the document, the young man was inspired by the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. In Texas, his goal was to murder as many Hispanic civilians as possible. Carrying an AK-47-style assault rifle, he [killed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence) twenty people and wounded twenty-six others. Apparently, he intended to spark a race war—or, rather, to accelerate a race war that he already believed to be in progress. “Do your part and spread this brothers!” he wrote on 8chan. “Keep up the good fight.”\n\nWhite-supremacist terrorism is nothing new, but this sickeningly specific instantiation of it—lone shooter, assault rifle, online manifesto, a link to a live stream—appears to be contagious. Thirteen hours after the massacre in El Paso, a shooter opened fire outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio. It’s not yet clear what his motive was, but eyewitnesses described him as a white man in his twenties. On Saturday, 8chan users passed around a Google spreadsheet listing some of these shootings: date, location, number of kills. Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who are commonly referred to on 8chan as “martyrs,” were at the top of the list. The El Paso shooter was at the bottom. It’s hard to imagine that this list won’t keep growing.\n\nThe national conversation will now turn, as it should, to gun control, to mental illness, and to [the President’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) practice of exacerbating racial tensions, which has been one of his avocations for decades and now appears to be his central reëlection strategy. But there’s also a more specific question: what can be done about the fact that so many of these terrorists—in [Pittsburgh](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pittsburgh-shooting-and-the-dark-specific-logic-of-online-hatred), in [Poway](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-poway-synagogue-shooting-follows-an-unsettling-new-script), in [Christchurch](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-zealand-shooting-and-the-great-man-theory-of-misery), in El Paso—seem to find inspiration in the same online spaces? Each killer, in the moment, may have acted alone, but they all appear to have been zealous converts to the same ideology—a paranoid snarl of raw anger, radical nationalism, unhinged nihilism, and fears of “white genocide” that is still referred to as “fringe,” although it’s creeping precariously close to the mainstream. On many social networks that bill themselves as bulwarks of “free speech,” including Gab, 4chan, and 8chan, this way of thinking is so dominant that it is often taken for granted. In April, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that such platforms “serve as round-the-clock white supremacist rallies.”\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nCan these platforms simply be shut down? The answer is complicated, but basically binary: there is a lot that private companies can do to censor speech, but much less that the government can do. The United States has some of the most expansive free-speech protections in the world. There are exceptions, such as incitement to violence, but the bar to prove incitement is quite high. In the nineteen-sixties, a Ku Klux Klan leader was arrested under an Ohio law that prohibited advocating “crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism.” But the Supreme Court—at the time, arguably the most liberal Court in American history—ruled unanimously that the Klan leader’s First Amendment rights had been violated. This case, Brandenburg v. Ohio, laid out the standard that still applies: the government can only censor speech if it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action.” Some of the recent white-supremacist manifestos might meet this standard, and yet, even if one or several of them could be banned, this wouldn’t necessarily apply to the platforms on which the manifestos are posted. According to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, a site’s owner is not liable for the content on that site. In March, the Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/22/chan-looks-like-terrorist-recruiting-site-after-new-zealand-shooting-should-government-treat-it-like-one/?utm_term=.56d68796a5ed) that the owner of 8chan, Jim Watkins, an American living in the Philippines, had “built a technical fortress to guard 8chan from potential takedowns.” The site’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer works at the company, told the *Post* that Watkins was “content to lose money” on the site: “8chan is like a boat to Jim.” A boat may be full of snakes, or explosives, but this doesn’t guarantee that the government will be able to seize it.\n\nStill, even in the absence of government intervention, there are other pressures that can be brought to bear. In August of 2017, a few days after the white-supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, a Web-security company called Cloudflare severed its relationship with a neo-Nazi propaganda site called the Daily Stormer. Without Cloudflare’s protection, the Daily Stormer would be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, allowing [online vigilantes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers) to crash the site more or less at will. “Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion,” Matthew Prince, the C.E.O. of Cloudflare, [wrote](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) on the company’s blog. “Now, having made that decision, let me explain why it’s so dangerous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.”\n\nCloudflare still offers its protective services to 8chan. “We’re the Fedex of the internet, passing messages on, not looking inside the boxes,” Cloudflare’s head of policy told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/03/15/after-the-new-zealand-terror-attack-should-8chan-be-wiped-from-the-web/#192d45e96263) in March. But, after Cloudflare had made an exception to this rule by banning the Daily Stormer, this was no longer entirely true. “It’s powerful to be able to say you’ve never done something,” Prince wrote in his blog post. “And, after today, make no mistake, it will be a little bit harder for us to argue against a government somewhere pressuring us into taking down a site they don’t like.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Terrorism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"terrorism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00be2179605b11ad993c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Andrew Marantz, a staff writer, has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2011.

His goal was to create a census of the rat population—not to become a footnote in Presidential politics. His estimate of just over two million rats in the city would have been horrifying but for the long-held belief that New York housed equal numbers of rats and humans, as if a municipal sponsor program had assigned each of the eight million New Yorkers a muck-dwelling murine counterpart. The good news was that every four New Yorkers shared just one rat. \n\nAt the time, the data was touted as settling the continual debate over the size of New York’s rat population. But it’s emblematic that it is now pertinent to [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s defamatory attack upon (yet another) American constituency. Trump’s most recent Twitter invective spree targeted Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and the chair of the powerful House Oversight Committee, whose district includes parts of the city of Baltimore, and whose committee is conducting multiple investigations of the President. Trump referred to Cummings’s district, Maryland’s Seventh, as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.” The Baltimore *Sun* shot back with an editorial headlined “Better to have a few rats than to be one.” Trump does not possess great reserves of self-awareness, or else he would have chosen his insult more carefully. Last year, the pest-control company Orkin released its annual list of the “rattiest” cities in the United States, based on how many new rodent treatments the company performed. Baltimore, despite some noted improvements, made the list for the third year in a row, coming in at ninth place. New York came in third—with, again, one rat for every four people. (Chicago came in first, for the fourth year in a row.)\n\n“No human being would want to live there,” Trump said of Baltimore on Twitter, implicitly questioning the humanity of the six hundred thousand human beings who do, in fact, live there. A little more than twenty per cent of the people in Baltimore are under the age of eighteen. How those young people are to find inspiration, cultivate pride in their communities, or gain a sense of their own potential when the President of the United States has called their home unfit for human habitation is a matter that Trump left unaddressed, if that concern even grazed his conscience. His use of the term “human” is implicit code for “white”—it recalled the language of the nineteen-nineties-era Los Angeles Police Department, which often referred to shootings in which both the perpetrator and victim were minorities as N.H.I.s, for “no humans involved.” On Saturday, the CNN anchor Victor Blackwell struggled to maintain his composure as he [spoke about Baltimore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYANRUos8Hg), the city he grew up in; the fully American aspirations of the people who live and work there; and the loaded, racist ways in which Trump has used the term “infested.” Five of the people the President has [most recently singled out](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/donald-trumps-idea-of-selective-citizenship) for condemnation, all members of the House of Representatives, are members of minority communities. \n\nThere are discernibly more rats in New York than there are in Baltimore, but some of the rats in Baltimore have effectively been enabled by New Yorkers—more specifically, Jared Kushner, the New York real-estate baron and Trump’s son-in-law. The [Washington *Post* reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/jared-kushner-owns-lots-of-apartments-in-the-baltimore-area-some-infested-with-mice/2019/07/28/0d3cb754-b13b-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html?utm_term=.3f41dac4fb61) that Kushner’s company has owned some nine thousand apartments in Baltimore that generated, in a single year, more than two hundred complaints of disrepair, code violations, and rodent infestation. The company has been sued and issued financial penalties for failing to address these concerns in a timely manner. \n\nAll of this is immaterial to Trump. His vision of the disparate worlds that the recent targets of his ire come from is uniformly dystopian—a free association of skin color with filth and crime. As President, he has attacked an untold number of individuals—actually, we have [some idea](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/reasons-why-donald-trump-is-unfit-to-be-president) of the number—but the racist themes in his screeds are hard to miss. In 2017, he attacked John Lewis, the civil-rights-movement veteran and Georgia congressman, saying that the Atlanta district that Lewis represents is “crime infested” and “falling apart.” The district is actually home to one of the largest concentrations of college-educated and affluent black people in the country. But that fact was insignificant to Trump, whose rhetoric betrays a kind of mass racial profiling: Lewis is black and so are the majority of his constituents, and we all know what kind of conditions those people live under. Trump said as much in his left-handed appeals to black voters in 2016. “Horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody has seen,” he said. “What the hell do you have to lose?” Self-respect, apparently. \n\nTrump’s use of “infestation” is another metaphor meant to cloak his own culpabilities. He railed about Washington, D.C., being a swamp of corruption before installing his own regime of [Boss Tweedian indulgences](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/watchdog-ben-carsons-table-spending-broke-law/589804/), with multiple Cabinet members accused of ethics violations or graft. He launched his Presidential campaign decrying Mexican “rapists,” only to be accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than twenty women. He frequently bashes black politicians for the poverty in inner cities, although these are places whose well-being he, as President, is responsible for as well. He is not alone in that practice: Republican criticism of Democratic leadership has frequently pointed to poverty in cities where minority populations overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. But ten of the twelve poorest states in the union—Alabama, South Carolina, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, Florida, and Mississippi—are not only led by Republican governors but have legislatures in which the G.O.P. has majorities in both houses. On Sunday morning, when Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, appeared on Fox News to defend Trump, he claimed that he would have been “fired” if there were poverty in his former district, South Carolina’s Fifth, like there is in Baltimore. Critics on social media hastened to point out that Mulvaney’s district was actually slightly *poorer* than Cummings’s is. \n\nThe Baltimore *Sun* further noted that, when Trump referred to the communities that Cummings represents, he omitted more affluent ones such as Ellicott City and Baldwin in favor of the poorer areas of Baltimore—places that he could ridicule en route to making his hyperbolic point. This is the essence of racism: an epidermal association of a group of people with the worst possibilities, even when—especially when—available evidence points to the contrary. \n\nThe human aversion to rats is ancient and abiding. They are vectors of *Clostridium difficile*, salmonella, *E. coli*, and *Leptospira*—consumers of refuse and carriers of pestilence. The evidence of their presence is noted by burrows in the earth; droppings, which may cause asthma; and the greasy trail that they frequently leave in their wake. They inspire disgust for good reason and yet, for all their liabilities, they possess a singular virtue that Donald Trump lacks: they make no attempt to deny what they actually are.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1e267e716b454591af6a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Baltimore","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"baltimore"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e471","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Racism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"racism"},{"id":"5c2e1d322bc86f2c9a244a5b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tweets","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tweets"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c957a4e65be2f29d55262","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

Pigment is something foundational—a navigational star in the night sky of his world view. When a man introduces himself to the American electorate by lying about the origins of the first black President, and then proceeds to baselessly refer to Mexicans in the United States as rapists, nothing he does after that can be considered surprising.\n\nIn that regard, Trump’s eruption last week, in which he attacked (but did not name) Representatives [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party), Ayanna Pressley, [Ilhan Omar](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/ilhan-omars-embattled-first-months-in-office), and Rashida Tlaib, tweeting that they should “go back” to where they came from, and later accused them of hating America, could not be called unexpected. It was alarming, though, and it raised the question, once again, of whether Trump had finally gone too far. For the past two years, observers have been divided about whether Trump’s tweets are calculated trolling, designed to keep his opponents off balance, or the sincere expressions of an unbalanced psyche. The current outburst indicates that the answer is both.\n\nBefore Trump intervened, the story in the media was about the roiling conflict between the congresswomen—the so-called Squad—and House Speaker [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), this time over border policy. Trump, in suggesting that the four U.S. citizens self-deport, prompted the Speaker to stop sniping at them and to fire back at him. Trump’s real agenda, she said, is about “making America white again.” Last Tuesday, Republicans in the House of Representatives were forced to go on the record about the incident, when that chamber voted on a resolution condemning the tweets, which Pelosi termed “racist.” Her comment was, technically, a violation of House rules and it was “taken down,” but she did not apologize. Only four Republicans supported the resolution.\n\nMost likely, Trump never considered what consequences his attack would have on Capitol Hill. He seems to think that his outré rage at the four women—They are not white, they are radicals, and only I can save you from what they will bring—will play well to his base, and that’s all that matters. He revealed as much when he told reporters that he is “enjoying” the fight and thinks that he is “winning it by a lot.” A majority of people polled found Trump’s tweets offensive and “un-American,” but his approval ratings rose among Republicans.\n\nWith his habitual grandiosity, Trump has previously declared himself “the least racist person anybody is going to meet.” (Last Tuesday, he tweeted, “I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!”) By way of evidence, he repeatedly commits the defensive racist’s primary tell: listing the names of all the black people he knows, like a roster of character witnesses in a criminal trial. This most recent incident highlights a theme of Trump’s pronouncements as they pertain to people of color. He presents the citizenship of black and brown Americans as a kind of probation that can be revoked for the most minor infractions of protocol.\n\nIlhan Omar is a Somali-born refugee who became a naturalized U.S. citizen at the age of seventeen. She is American enough to serve in Congress but not enough for Trump, who has shown an increasing disregard for the very principle of asylum. Rashida Tlaib was born in Detroit, to immigrant parents. Ayanna Pressley was born, to African-American parents, in Cincinnati. Her family has been here longer than Trump’s, and, as African-Americans, they are part of a population that was forcibly brought to this country to do its labor. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, to parents of Puerto Rican descent, which means that, even if she did go back to where her ancestors came from, she would still be in America.\n\nThe idea of selective citizenship is not uncommon in American history. The nation’s first immigration law, passed in 1790, allowed for the naturalization of white immigrants only. It took the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1868, to establish that birthright citizenship also applies to blacks. As Jill Lepore notes, in her book “This America,” another thirty years passed before the Supreme Court found, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that birthright citizenship applies to a person of Asian descent, and it was another quarter century before the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 declared that all indigenous people born in the United States are citizens. Trump isn’t just attacking four women of color; he is reanimating ideas whose prevalence wreaked havoc in the nation’s past.\n\nWe were reminded, last week, of something that we have known all along about the President: he will say anything that he thinks will serve his ends, regardless of the risk it may pose to his fellow-Americans. According to the F.B.I., hate crimes rose by seventeen per cent during his first year in office. Last year, a man who described his attachment to Trump’s rallies as a kind of addiction, mailed explosive devices (which did not detonate) to various media outlets and politicians whom he considered to be the President’s enemies. The worry is that Trump’s most recent fulminations will find their way to other vulnerable and dangerous observers.\n\nHis behavior carries another significant implication. The conflict between Pelosi and the Squad centered on votes for a border-funding bill, but it has at its root a more fundamental conflict: progressive legislators want to launch an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi fears that it would only help Trump win reëlection. After the Mueller report was released, Tlaib recirculated a resolution, which she had previously introduced, to launch such an inquiry; the other members of the Squad signed on to it. More than eighty House Democrats have now called for an inquiry. Last Wednesday, the House [voted to table](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-movement-to-impeach-donald-trump-has-only-just-begun) the latest impeachment resolution from Representative Al Green (his third), but ninety-five Democrats voted to keep it on the floor. Pelosi reportedly told senior House Democrats last month that she would rather see Trump in prison than impeached. His ineptitude may yet spur the two factions toward a productive rapprochement. Robert Mueller’s testimony before two House committees, which is scheduled for this week, may further clarify the resolution.\n\nHas Trump finally gone too far? A few hours after the House vote, he addressed a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, in which he renewed his attacks on the congresswomen, and said that Democrats were set on “the destruction of our country,” as his followers chanted, “Send her back!” The next day, he claimed that he was “not happy” with the chants, and tried to stop them, but he did not. The evidence of Trump’s unfitness for the Presidency—whether it is calculated or simply deranged—is inescapable. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca141c92e2c9b85da59","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pres.

But, if finding words for the worst is not within our power, finding them for what’s about as bad as bad can be is—and that is the case with the two gun massacres that took place over the weekend, in El Paso, Texas, with twenty-two dead, and Dayton, Ohio, with nine. Though neither is the worst that we have seen in recent years, together they had a particular brutality about them.     \n\nThose who have made gun sanity a consuming cause can only weep at these events. Figuring out what to say is hard enough; figuring out what to do is even harder, since no more actions seem likely to result from these incidents than did from other state-sanctioned mass shootings of recent years. (When the state, knowing what ought to be done, doesn’t do it, it sanctions what gets done instead.) To read of Jordan Anchondo, who died of bullet wounds because she threw her body over her two-month-old son to save him, and her husband, Andre, who died beside her while trying to protect them both, is to move past tears of pity to those of rage. This should never happen. But, amid the sheer madness and horror of the killings, it seems worth making some necessary distinctions. We can’t act wisely without seeing straight, and we can’t see straight if we don’t see clearly. \n\nFirst point of clarity: the problem is guns, their availability, their lethality, their omnipresence in American life, and their protection by the ruling political party. There are racists in every country. There are video games in every country. There are mentally ill people in every country. There are not gun massacres in every country. And, when there is one, [comprehensive new laws are passed](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-gun-policy-global-comparisons), and there is seldom another. Why are there so many in America? Because there are too many guns in America, and, in particular, too many lethal guns easily purchased—guns modelled on military weapons whose only purpose is to kill as many people as rapidly as possible. Study after study, correlation after correlation provide the evidence on this point: control guns and you reduce gun violence. If we banned assault weapons and all their diabolic accessories, the number of gun massacres in America would be reduced—as was true during the decade between 1994 and 2004, when there was a [federal ban](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188421) on such weapons. We can have the same confidence in this correlation as we do in the efficacy of vaccines or antibiotics. Gun control works.  \n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nTo say this isn’t to deny the significance of the discernible motives of the killers. Apparently, the shooting in El Paso was an act of white-supremacist terrorism, and, judging from a manifesto allegedly written by the killer, he may have taken license, if not direction, from the [racist in the White House](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-racist-in-the-white-house-donald-trump-tweets-ocasio-cortez-tlaib-omar-pressley). (The author of the manifesto said that his convictions “predate Trump.”) Everything that [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) does as a demagogue involves, in classic demagogic fashion, giving license to others to act on their impulses without shame. And the fact that he, in a classic demagogic move, then recoils from the consequences of his words does not make them less empowering. Trump’s rote condemnation of bigotry, during his brief comments at the White House on Monday morning—seemingly authored by some other hand, and delivered with his usual insincerity, right down to his naming the wrong Ohio city—cannot permit him to escape responsibility for what his more spontaneous words may have wrought. There is, of course, a difference between words that are the direct causes of violence and words that create a climate in which violence is increasingly possible, but to recognize that difference is not to clear the demagogue of blame. \n\nThe danger with evoking the climate as though it were the cause, however, is that there are many climates in a country as big as this one. The next gun massacre may be motivated by some form of Islamist extremism, as in San Bernardino, or by some incoherent personal motive, as at [Sandy Hook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting), or by no discernible motive at all, as in the massacre in Las Vegas. People will find all kinds of reasons to kill. It is, crucially, the weapon in the killer’s hand that matters.\n\nSecond distinction: there is a difference between those who fight to make gun control impossible and those who use guns to kill people. The majority of the first, much larger group often view weapons as powerful symbols of personal autonomy. (The deaths of innocents are, seemingly, a price necessarily paid for that idea of freedom.) As [Alec Wilkinson](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alec-wilkinson) [has written](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dark-presence-of-guns), recalling his brief time as a police officer who had a gun but used it only at a firing range, in a small Cape Cod town, “a gun was an object in which a power of nature was concentrated so forcefully that a person could use one and feel party to a solemn and thrilling mystery.” Most of us satisfy our appetite for a symbol of personal autonomy in the form of more nonlethal objects—cars, or old guitars, or nice shoes. People who oppose gun control at every turn often cite the sense of control and power that weapons provide, regardless of how false that sense may be. The vast majority of those people will never shoot anyone, but they help put lethal weapons in the hands of those who will. \n\nThird distinction: the Second Amendment is, in these arguments, a red herring—a blood-red herring, perhaps, but a distraction nonetheless. There is no Second Amendment guarantee of an individual’s right to own guns; the claim that there is is a recent and radical invention of the Supreme Court, in its decision in [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-gilroy-shooting-and-what-the-democratic-candidates-should-remember-about-justice-john-paul-stevens). In any case, even within the absurdities of the Heller ruling, there is plenty of room for gun restrictions.\n\nThe strangest thing is that there are no really rational counter-arguments to be made against gun restrictions—merely the ritual invocation of the Second Amendment, misconstrued, and the argument for self-defense, which has been so often exploded that it no longer has even rhetorical weight. (Self-defense against the kind of weapons used in mass shootings is essentially impossible. And acts of self-defense attributed to gun ownership are, at best, [rare](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/), compared with the incidence of lethal gun violence.) In defense of the possession of lethal weapons meant for war, there is merely an appeal to “culture.” But, when your culture is killing children, you have to change it. Meanwhile, the solutions offered by the pro-gun lobby, parroted by Trump on Monday morning—a stronger death penalty, restrictions on video games—will change nothing. \n\nWhen we make distinctions, it frees us to act in concert—it sorts out our rage into distinct, specific pieces. Mothers Against Drunk Driving did not rage against the lethal danger of guns, or of climate change, or even against the internal-combustion engine. They raged against the drunk driving that was killing kids, and they had many small and simple solutions for it: ignition locks, sobriety checkpoints, better enforcement and clearer penalties, and a broader range of protections. There are simple solutions to our gun predicament that, though far from the wider—and, in other countries, universally shared—restrictions and impediments we need, would change the reality. Background checks, an effective assault-weapons ban, a complete ban on large magazines, and licensing and training, and insurance, minimally comparable to those that we all accept for car ownership, for gun ownership. Even those who still want guns for their symbolic purposes can likely be persuaded to accept at least some of these restrictions. And, by arguing for the best we can get now, we might create still another climate. Pursuing the possible is the only way we have to keep away the worst.

of [mass shootings](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence), over the past weekend, the prospects for gun-control legislation in Congress appear remote. The reason is no mystery. The National Rifle Association and its allies in the gun lobby maintain a firm grip on the Republican Party, including [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), and thus on veto power over the passage, or even the consideration, of measures to curb gun violence. But the power of the N.R.A. extends beyond its control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. It’s less well known that the N.R.A. has also transformed the judiciary and, in the process, rewritten our understanding of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nFor about two hundred years, the [meaning of the Second Amendment](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/so-you-think-you-know-the-second-amendment) was clear and mostly undisputed, despite the gnarled syntax of the text itself: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Generations of Supreme Court and academic opinion held that the amendment did not confer on individuals a right “to keep and bear Arms” but, rather, referred only to the privileges belonging to state militias. This was not a controversial view. The late Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said, in 1991, that the idea that the Second Amendment conferred a right for individuals to bear arms was “a fraud on the American public.” Burger was no liberal, and his view simply reflected the overwhelming consensus on the issue at the time. \n\nBut, starting in the nineteen-seventies, the N.R.A. undertook a patient and extensive effort to change the public, and eventually the judicial, understanding of the Second Amendment. As David Cole recounts in his book “[Engines of Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/Engines-Liberty-Citizen-Activists-Constitutional/dp/0465060900),” the N.R.A. recognized that its path was blocked by binding precedents in the federal courts, so it turned to a state-by-state approach. Embracing and passing gun-rights legislation in the states, Cole writes, “fostered a legal culture in which the right to bear arms enjoyed a privileged place.” At the same time, the N.R.A. sponsored academic research that purported to show that the traditional understanding of the Second Amendment was incorrect. The movement reached its climax in 2008, when the Supreme Court, in [Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf) in District of Columbia v. Heller, rewrote its understanding of the Second Amendment, and concluded that the Framers of the Constitution had, after all, intended the Amendment to confer an individual right to bear arms. (As Adam Gopnik [recently observed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-gilroy-shooting-and-what-the-democratic-candidates-should-remember-about-justice-john-paul-stevens), Justice John Paul Stevens’s dissent had the better argument, but Scalia’s opinion had the five votes.)\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nCole, who is now the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, draws an important parallel to the N.R.A.’s effort to transform the meaning of the Second—that is, the movement to guarantee a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Of course, these two efforts to change the political trajectory of the country went in opposite ideological directions. But the strategies behind them were remarkably similar. In both cases, the legal terrain, especially in the federal courts, was clearly hostile. In both, the movement for change began succeeding at the state level, and, in both, the culmination came at the Supreme Court. With regard to both gun rights and same-sex marriage, the Court ultimately yielded to a political movement that had mobilized legislators, academics, and ordinary citizens.\n\nThere is a lesson in these politically divergent victories for the current moment. Though the Supreme Court has been cautious since 2008 in expanding gun rights, there is every likelihood that the new conservative majority will frustrate federal or state legislative efforts to insure gun safety. In other words, even if Congress or states manage to pass laws restricting gun rights—including limits on assault weapons or even requiring universal background checks—there is a real possibility that a majority of the Justices will overturn these laws as violations of the Second Amendment. \n\nBut the lesson of the fight over gun rights—like that over the protection of same-sex marriage—is that the Constitution remains a political document that is subject to the ideological forces of the time. No victory, or defeat, is permanent. The Court changed the Second Amendment, and the Court can change it back again, in its original direction. This kind of change takes significant resources and enormous patience. At the moment, the future of gun control looks grim in all three branches of the federal government. Trump is President, the Republicans control the Senate, and conservative appointees dominate the Supreme Court. Control of the elected branches is up for grabs in less than a year and a half. Control of the Supreme Court will, of course, take much longer to change. But even the Court usually bends with public and political opinion over time, and that change may yet happen on guns. The grim lesson of recent weeks is that the need for that transformation has never been greater.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8d22d4972cd5b832b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second Amendment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"second-amendment"},{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e470","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gun Control","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gun-control"},{"id":"5c2e1c96e56e652c9027468c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Supreme Court","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"supreme-court"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02be019dfc3494ea4162","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jeffrey Toobin has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1993 and the senior legal analyst for CNN since 2002.

According to the document, the young man was inspired by the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. In Texas, his goal was to murder as many Hispanic civilians as possible. Carrying an AK-47-style assault rifle, he [killed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence) twenty people and wounded twenty-six others. Apparently, he intended to spark a race war—or, rather, to accelerate a race war that he already believed to be in progress. “Do your part and spread this brothers!” he wrote on 8chan. “Keep up the good fight.”\n\nWhite-supremacist terrorism is nothing new, but this sickeningly specific instantiation of it—lone shooter, assault rifle, online manifesto, a link to a live stream—appears to be contagious. Thirteen hours after the massacre in El Paso, a shooter opened fire outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio. It’s not yet clear what his motive was, but eyewitnesses described him as a white man in his twenties. On Saturday, 8chan users passed around a Google spreadsheet listing some of these shootings: date, location, number of kills. Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who are commonly referred to on 8chan as “martyrs,” were at the top of the list. The El Paso shooter was at the bottom. It’s hard to imagine that this list won’t keep growing.\n\nThe national conversation will now turn, as it should, to gun control, to mental illness, and to [the President’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) practice of exacerbating racial tensions, which has been one of his avocations for decades and now appears to be his central reëlection strategy. But there’s also a more specific question: what can be done about the fact that so many of these terrorists—in [Pittsburgh](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pittsburgh-shooting-and-the-dark-specific-logic-of-online-hatred), in [Poway](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-poway-synagogue-shooting-follows-an-unsettling-new-script), in [Christchurch](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-zealand-shooting-and-the-great-man-theory-of-misery), in El Paso—seem to find inspiration in the same online spaces? Each killer, in the moment, may have acted alone, but they all appear to have been zealous converts to the same ideology—a paranoid snarl of raw anger, radical nationalism, unhinged nihilism, and fears of “white genocide” that is still referred to as “fringe,” although it’s creeping precariously close to the mainstream. On many social networks that bill themselves as bulwarks of “free speech,” including Gab, 4chan, and 8chan, this way of thinking is so dominant that it is often taken for granted. In April, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that such platforms “serve as round-the-clock white supremacist rallies.”\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nCan these platforms simply be shut down? The answer is complicated, but basically binary: there is a lot that private companies can do to censor speech, but much less that the government can do. The United States has some of the most expansive free-speech protections in the world. There are exceptions, such as incitement to violence, but the bar to prove incitement is quite high. In the nineteen-sixties, a Ku Klux Klan leader was arrested under an Ohio law that prohibited advocating “crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism.” But the Supreme Court—at the time, arguably the most liberal Court in American history—ruled unanimously that the Klan leader’s First Amendment rights had been violated. This case, Brandenburg v. Ohio, laid out the standard that still applies: the government can only censor speech if it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action.” Some of the recent white-supremacist manifestos might meet this standard, and yet, even if one or several of them could be banned, this wouldn’t necessarily apply to the platforms on which the manifestos are posted. According to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, a site’s owner is not liable for the content on that site. In March, the Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/22/chan-looks-like-terrorist-recruiting-site-after-new-zealand-shooting-should-government-treat-it-like-one/?utm_term=.56d68796a5ed) that the owner of 8chan, Jim Watkins, an American living in the Philippines, had “built a technical fortress to guard 8chan from potential takedowns.” The site’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer works at the company, told the *Post* that Watkins was “content to lose money” on the site: “8chan is like a boat to Jim.” A boat may be full of snakes, or explosives, but this doesn’t guarantee that the government will be able to seize it.\n\nStill, even in the absence of government intervention, there are other pressures that can be brought to bear. In August of 2017, a few days after the white-supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, a Web-security company called Cloudflare severed its relationship with a neo-Nazi propaganda site called the Daily Stormer. Without Cloudflare’s protection, the Daily Stormer would be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, allowing [online vigilantes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers) to crash the site more or less at will. “Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion,” Matthew Prince, the C.E.O. of Cloudflare, [wrote](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) on the company’s blog. “Now, having made that decision, let me explain why it’s so dangerous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.”\n\nCloudflare still offers its protective services to 8chan. “We’re the Fedex of the internet, passing messages on, not looking inside the boxes,” Cloudflare’s head of policy told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/03/15/after-the-new-zealand-terror-attack-should-8chan-be-wiped-from-the-web/#192d45e96263) in March. But, after Cloudflare had made an exception to this rule by banning the Daily Stormer, this was no longer entirely true. “It’s powerful to be able to say you’ve never done something,” Prince wrote in his blog post. “And, after today, make no mistake, it will be a little bit harder for us to argue against a government somewhere pressuring us into taking down a site they don’t like.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Terrorism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"terrorism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00be2179605b11ad993c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Andrew Marantz, a staff writer, has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2011.

As David Cole recounts in his book “[Engines of Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/Engines-Liberty-Citizen-Activists-Constitutional/dp/0465060900),” the N.R.A. recognized that its path was blocked by binding precedents in the federal courts, so it turned to a state-by-state approach. Embracing and passing gun-rights legislation in the states, Cole writes, “fostered a legal culture in which the right to bear arms enjoyed a privileged place.” At the same time, the N.R.A. sponsored academic research that purported to show that the traditional understanding of the Second Amendment was incorrect. The movement reached its climax in 2008, when the Supreme Court, in [Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf) in District of Columbia v. Heller, rewrote its understanding of the Second Amendment, and concluded that the Framers of the Constitution had, after all, intended the Amendment to confer an individual right to bear arms. (As Adam Gopnik [recently observed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-gilroy-shooting-and-what-the-democratic-candidates-should-remember-about-justice-john-paul-stevens), Justice John Paul Stevens’s dissent had the better argument, but Scalia’s opinion had the five votes.)\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nCole, who is now the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, draws an important parallel to the N.R.A.’s effort to transform the meaning of the Second—that is, the movement to guarantee a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Of course, these two efforts to change the political trajectory of the country went in opposite ideological directions. But the strategies behind them were remarkably similar. In both cases, the legal terrain, especially in the federal courts, was clearly hostile. In both, the movement for change began succeeding at the state level, and, in both, the culmination came at the Supreme Court. With regard to both gun rights and same-sex marriage, the Court ultimately yielded to a political movement that had mobilized legislators, academics, and ordinary citizens.\n\nThere is a lesson in these politically divergent victories for the current moment. Though the Supreme Court has been cautious since 2008 in expanding gun rights, there is every likelihood that the new conservative majority will frustrate federal or state legislative efforts to insure gun safety. In other words, even if Congress or states manage to pass laws restricting gun rights—including limits on assault weapons or even requiring universal background checks—there is a real possibility that a majority of the Justices will overturn these laws as violations of the Second Amendment. \n\nBut the lesson of the fight over gun rights—like that over the protection of same-sex marriage—is that the Constitution remains a political document that is subject to the ideological forces of the time. No victory, or defeat, is permanent. The Court changed the Second Amendment, and the Court can change it back again, in its original direction. This kind of change takes significant resources and enormous patience. At the moment, the future of gun control looks grim in all three branches of the federal government. Trump is President, the Republicans control the Senate, and conservative appointees dominate the Supreme Court. Control of the elected branches is up for grabs in less than a year and a half. Control of the Supreme Court will, of course, take much longer to change. But even the Court usually bends with public and political opinion over time, and that change may yet happen on guns. The grim lesson of recent weeks is that the need for that transformation has never been greater.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8d22d4972cd5b832b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8d22d4972cd5b832b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second

According to the document, the young man was inspired by the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. In Texas, his goal was to murder as many Hispanic civilians as possible. Carrying an AK-47-style assault rifle, he [killed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence) twenty people and wounded twenty-six others. Apparently, he intended to spark a race war—or, rather, to accelerate a race war that he already believed to be in progress. “Do your part and spread this brothers!” he wrote on 8chan. “Keep up the good fight.”\n\nWhite-supremacist terrorism is nothing new, but this sickeningly specific instantiation of it—lone shooter, assault rifle, online manifesto, a link to a live stream—appears to be contagious. Thirteen hours after the massacre in El Paso, a shooter opened fire outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio. It’s not yet clear what his motive was, but eyewitnesses described him as a white man in his twenties. On Saturday, 8chan users passed around a Google spreadsheet listing some of these shootings: date, location, number of kills. Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who are commonly referred to on 8chan as “martyrs,” were at the top of the list. The El Paso shooter was at the bottom. It’s hard to imagine that this list won’t keep growing.\n\nThe national conversation will now turn, as it should, to gun control, to mental illness, and to [the President’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) practice of exacerbating racial tensions, which has been one of his avocations for decades and now appears to be his central reëlection strategy. But there’s also a more specific question: what can be done about the fact that so many of these terrorists—in [Pittsburgh](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pittsburgh-shooting-and-the-dark-specific-logic-of-online-hatred), in [Poway](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-poway-synagogue-shooting-follows-an-unsettling-new-script), in [Christchurch](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-new-zealand-shooting-and-the-great-man-theory-of-misery), in El Paso—seem to find inspiration in the same online spaces? Each killer, in the moment, may have acted alone, but they all appear to have been zealous converts to the same ideology—a paranoid snarl of raw anger, radical nationalism, unhinged nihilism, and fears of “white genocide” that is still referred to as “fringe,” although it’s creeping precariously close to the mainstream. On many social networks that bill themselves as bulwarks of “free speech,” including Gab, 4chan, and 8chan, this way of thinking is so dominant that it is often taken for granted. In April, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that such platforms “serve as round-the-clock white supremacist rallies.”\n\n +++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nCan these platforms simply be shut down? The answer is complicated, but basically binary: there is a lot that private companies can do to censor speech, but much less that the government can do. The United States has some of the most expansive free-speech protections in the world. There are exceptions, such as incitement to violence, but the bar to prove incitement is quite high. In the nineteen-sixties, a Ku Klux Klan leader was arrested under an Ohio law that prohibited advocating “crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism.” But the Supreme Court—at the time, arguably the most liberal Court in American history—ruled unanimously that the Klan leader’s First Amendment rights had been violated. This case, Brandenburg v. Ohio, laid out the standard that still applies: the government can only censor speech if it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action.” Some of the recent white-supremacist manifestos might meet this standard, and yet, even if one or several of them could be banned, this wouldn’t necessarily apply to the platforms on which the manifestos are posted. According to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” In other words, a site’s owner is not liable for the content on that site. In March, the Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/22/chan-looks-like-terrorist-recruiting-site-after-new-zealand-shooting-should-government-treat-it-like-one/?utm_term=.56d68796a5ed) that the owner of 8chan, Jim Watkins, an American living in the Philippines, had “built a technical fortress to guard 8chan from potential takedowns.” The site’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer works at the company, told the *Post* that Watkins was “content to lose money” on the site: “8chan is like a boat to Jim.” A boat may be full of snakes, or explosives, but this doesn’t guarantee that the government will be able to seize it.\n\nStill, even in the absence of government intervention, there are other pressures that can be brought to bear. In August of 2017, a few days after the white-supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, a Web-security company called Cloudflare severed its relationship with a neo-Nazi propaganda site called the Daily Stormer. Without Cloudflare’s protection, the Daily Stormer would be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, allowing [online vigilantes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers) to crash the site more or less at will. “Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion,” Matthew Prince, the C.E.O. of Cloudflare, [wrote](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) on the company’s blog. “Now, having made that decision, let me explain why it’s so dangerous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online.”\n\nCloudflare still offers its protective services to 8chan. “We’re the Fedex of the internet, passing messages on, not looking inside the boxes,” Cloudflare’s head of policy told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/03/15/after-the-new-zealand-terror-attack-should-8chan-be-wiped-from-the-web/#192d45e96263) in March. But, after Cloudflare had made an exception to this rule by banning the Daily Stormer, this was no longer entirely true. “It’s powerful to be able to say you’ve never done something,” Prince wrote in his blog post. “And, after today, make no mistake, it will be a little bit harder for us to argue against a government somewhere pressuring us into taking down a site they don’t like.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1dd82710c62d1081559d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Paso","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Terrorism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"terrorism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00be2179605b11ad993c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Andrew Marantz, a staff writer, has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2011.

After obtaining a green card, he moved to Texas, in 1991, as a U.S. resident. He studied medicine at the University of Texas at San Antonio, started his residency in Buffalo, and, in 2003, obtained his U.S. citizenship. “Becoming a citizen is more than a piece of paper,” Sainz told me, on Sunday morning, in the El Paso offices of Pininos Pediatrics, where he is the chief doctor specializing in pediatric critical care. “I needed to understand exactly what I was getting myself into before I said, ‘O.K., I want to be a citizen.” As we talked in his office, half a mile from the U.S. border with Mexico, he offered me coffee and cookies before describing his role in tending to victims of [the mass shooting](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mass-shootings-in-el-paso-and-dayton-should-spur-democrats-to-propose-big-ideas-on-gun-violence) nearby that killed twenty people on Saturday. “Honestly, I’m still trying to understand what I got myself into,” he said, referring to his decision to move to the U.S. “But I came here for hope, and I became a doctor to give that back. The more you give, the more you get.”\n\nNow forty-seven years old, Sainz, who wears glasses and combs his graying hair straight back, has been practicing medicine for nearly fifteen years in El Paso, which he described as “the best of both worlds—living here and living *there*,” as he gestured back toward Mexico. He routinely cares for people from both sides of the border, including migrants fleeing from violence, who are suffering, he said, “from everything in the medical books.” Many are unaccompanied minors. Most are, he said, “very respectful and very determined.” Sainz treats them all the same. “They remind me of *me*,” he said, “because my family came through this country looking for a new beginning, too.”\n\n“It’s our job to care for everyone,” Sainz added, shrugging, “whether we get paid or not.”\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d46d10443af05000896cd1f]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn that respect alone—caring for patients, regardless of their origin—Saturday afternoon was like many before it for Sainz. Shortly before noon, he was driving to Del Sol Medical Center, a few exits down the highway from Cielo Vista Mall, to “visit with newborns” on behalf of a pediatrician friend who was out of town. A motorcycle sped past him, followed by state troopers. A helicopter buzzed overhead. He figured it was a high-speed chase. Inside the hospital, as he began tending to babies on the fourth floor, nurses started talking about a mass-casualty shooting nearby. He later learned that a white, twenty-one-year-old man named Patrick Crusius, from a Dallas suburb, had killed at least twenty people in and around a Walmart near the Cielo Vista Mall, injuring twenty-six others. Sainz described it to me as “a rich target. A very crowded area with many, many people from across the border, especially at the Walmart. Especially on a Saturday morning. Many times, you won’t hear a word of English there.” Sainz’s account of what happened at Del Sol—which treated eleven victims of Saturday’s mass shooting—has been edited and condensed.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n“I heard an announcement: ‘Any doctor, could you please come down to the E.R.’ So I said, O.K. I didn’t know if there were maybe some kids that were going to be brought over there. But I thought, Maybe I can be of some help.\n\n“Everybody is yelling, everybody is trying to get orders. I see the main trauma surgeon rushing around. He had already triaged some of the patients, and they were already moving them to the operating room so that they can make room for the next ones, the less sick ones, waiting in the hallway. Usually there are one or two people at these kinds of centers who are ready to deal with escalating trauma, but this was unprecedented. There is civil trauma and then there is military trauma, the stuff that happens at war. Ninety per cent of them die at the scene; maybe ten per cent survive. This was getting close to military trauma. This guy wasn’t shooting a .22 or a little rifle. I was seeing scooped-out flesh. It kept coming. And coming.\n\n“I’m a pediatrician, right? Well, for a while there, me and a maxillofacial surgeon—a very good dentist, basically—were running the show, coördinating care in the trauma ward. The few surgeons they had were already in the operating room. There is this very rigorous, quality-driven process where you get a privilege to go to the hospital. Well, people were operating yesterday with no privileges, because it was an emergency situation.\n\n“There were three people that I was taking care of at the same time. Somebody showed me a video later, of the shooting, and I could see some of them down on the Walmart floor. \n\n“We give fictitious trauma names to patients so they don’t get mixed up if they have the same or similar names. A machine spits them out. Some systems offer flower names for women and car names, like Cadillac or Mustang, for men.\n\n“All three spoke Spanish. All three were Americans. All three were critical. The woman was thirty-five and bleeding a lot. One man was also thirty-five and had been shot in the leg and had a pelvic injury. Another man was fifty-five and had been shot through the abdomen, and the bullet came out his buttocks. They were all able to communicate somewhat, but they also were all bleeding profusely. I was administering a lot of blood products, doing mass transfusions with these boxes of fresh blood. If you wait, they die. You guesstimate how much blood is lost, guesstimate vital signs, and start giving it. The thirty-five-year-old man would have probably died most quickly without the blood.\n\n“I spoke to them in Spanish, which they preferred. I just introduced myself. I said, ‘My name is Dr. Sainz. You have some injuries. We’re treating you. You’re going to be O.K. We’re here to help you. Please let us know if you have any pain, or anything else that you want us to know.’ We asked if they had any relatives that we could communicate to that they’re alive and there. Every so often—every five, seven, ten minutes—I’d go up to basically whisper to them, during the chaos, and tell them, ‘We’re still working on things. Things are moving in the right direction.’ Hopefully.\n\n“They’d just nod and say thank you. That’s what I remember.\n\n“Then we’re pushing them through CT scanners. Everyone’s yelling. Everybody’s administering blood, carefully. Everybody is signing these pieces of paper so there will be a track record at the end, so we can try to make some sense of where the blood went, who got it, all this stuff. We’re writing on napkins. \n\n“At some point, a rumor comes in, amid the chaos. The other hospital where patients went—the mall is halfway between two, and some patients went left and some went right—well, we heard there was an active shooter there. Hospitals are soft targets. I start thinking, This might be more organized than the usual shootings. I asked someone to call the other hospital and ask if it was real and he was, like, ‘No, no, no.’ I said, ‘Well, we need to move law enforcement here, right now, anyway, and lock this place down.’ And they did.\n\n“Resources arrived gradually and were all in place about four hours later. Backups arrived. I walked away. I went back to babies, in another hospital. I was in bed by four in the morning. Up by six-thirty. Normal.\n\n“If you go back one hundred and eighty years—when Texas was actually *Tejas*—people were crossing the river to come to *Tejas*, fighting for government representation, to speak English, to not be Catholic. They were fighting for equal rights back then, saying, ‘We are *Tejanos*, too.’ And here we are now. Saying the same thing! And somebody feels empowered to take someone else’s life, because they don’t look like Texans to him. Well, we are all equal. We’re *all* equal. And we’re all vulnerable.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e235f8c8f962cd419ccd2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"EL Paso, Texas","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-paso-texas"},{"id":"5c2e1c8cb75f002c8941e490","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hospitals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hospitals"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"}],"sections":[{"id":"595424dfab8b144c1b18882b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"As Told To","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"as-told-to"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b1dd6207318b5db98d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Charles Bethea has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2008 and became a staff writer in 2018.

It was one of a number of [attempts by the moderators](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/cnns-nonstop-hunt-for-drama-at-the-democratic-debate) to get the candidates to confront or even just slight one another directly, such as when Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, was asked whom on the stage she might have been comparing herself to when she said that she wouldn’t “make promises just to get elected.” (“Everyone wants to get elected,” she said.) Buttigieg, avoiding the crude insistence on youth that Representative Eric Swalwell, of California, who has since dropped out, indulged in during the previous debate, added, “You can have great Presidents at any age.” Sanders, as it happened, agreed with that.\n\nBut age was an image that Buttigieg deployed again and again, often deftly, sometimes as a metaphor, sometimes as a practical yardstick. Answering Lemon, he said that the particular vision he cared about candidates having was “one that can win,” which for him meant that it could not be “back to normal.” A sentence later, he used age to get at the related matter of legacy. There hadn’t been enough talk in the debate, he said, about [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s “enablers” in the Republican Party, who, by deferring to him, were supporting “naked racism.” He then looked directly into the camera and said, “If you are watching at home, and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that, when the sun sets on your career, and they are writing your story, of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether, in this moment, with this President, you found the courage to stand up to him or continue to put party over country.” If Lemon had, in effect, asked viewers to consider how young Buttigieg is now, Buttigieg had turned the question around to ask Republicans of all ages to imagine themselves when they are very old, and in the land of regret. \n\nAnd Buttigieg used his life span as a measure of the passage of time and the extent of political failures. “This is the exact same conversation we’ve been having since I was in high school,” he said, during an exchange about gun control. “I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened”—when two students at a Colorado high school shot and killed twelve of their classmates and a teacher, injuring twice as many. “I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school-shooting generation. We dare not allow there to be a third.” In other words, it was alarming to him that he had grown older than the problem; his own generational displacement only heightened the urgency of instituting at least minimal commonsense measures, such as effective universal background checks. On this topic, the distinctions among the candidates mostly had to do with whose commitment was the most sincere and long-standing. (Montana Governor Steve Bullock’s support for universal background checks was fairly recent; asked about that in Detroit, he mentioned that his eleven-year-old nephew, Jeremy, had been shot and killed in a playground.) “We know what to do, and it has not happened,” Buttigieg said. \n\nSimilarly, when Buttigieg was asked whether he would withdraw the remaining American troops from Afghanistan, where he was deployed in 2014, and where the first troops were sent in the months after the September 11th attacks, he said that, when he returned, “I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan. I thought I was turning out the lights years ago. Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody I knew—friend, roommate, colleague. We’re pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11.” (Trump, meanwhile, said last week, “I could win that war in a week. I just don’t want to kill ten million people.” He added that this victory would involve a “plan” in his possession for Afghanistan “to be wiped off the face of the Earth.” The remarks, understandably, caused an uproar in Afghanistan.)\n\nThe former congressman Beto O’Rourke, of El Paso, said that he would make a commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan in his first term, adding that he didn’t see how staying would “make it better.” [John Hickenlooper](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/john-hickenloopers-war-on-socialism), the former governor of Colorado, said that this approach would court disaster. But one of Buttigieg’s strongest points was that the authorization for the use of military force was one that Congress had approved a decade and a half ago, and that it has been stretched to cover deployments far from Afghanistan, too. No such vote has been called on the costs and benefits of further military engagement, whatever they may be, by the members of Congress who are accountable to this generation. “On my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed,” Buttigieg said. Such authorizations must have a limited life span; otherwise, wars will grow too old for soldiers who were too young. \n\nAnd there was another time span, which Buttigieg mentioned in both his opening and closing statements: twelve years, an estimate of the time left before we reach a climate catastrophe. “By 2030, we will pass the point of no return on climate,” he said, adding that by then there will also be a hundred and thirty million more guns on the street. “I’ll be in my forties then,” Buttigieg said. “If you have kids, think of how old they will be then.” They may even be ready to run for President.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5cabb073a036722123da7d62","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5cabb073a036722123da7d62","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pete Buttigieg","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pete-buttigieg"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Pete Buttigieg","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"pete-buttigieg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Party","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-party"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Democratic Party","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"democratic-party"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a01ff019dfc3494ea4158","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2014.

In retrospect, it was a strange thing to worry about. It took more than forty minutes for the debate to move to any topic other than Sanders’s signature issue, Medicare for All. Sanders had enough time to tally the number of Americans going bankrupt each year because of medical bills (five hundred thousand, more or less) and the amount of money that the health-care industry has spent on lobbying. CNN’s video introduction had, a little stagily, teased a fight between Sanders and [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elizabeth-warren) (“they’re fighting for the same cause—and the same voters”), but, when Sanders denounced the health-care industry’s political influence (it spent four and a half billion dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions during the past twenty years, he said), Warren nodded emphatically. Later, when Warren sounded a protectionist note on trade, Sanders returned the favor: “Elizabeth is absolutely right.” Present? Progressive ideas were the whole debate.\n\nMaybe this was because the two marquee progressives, Sanders and Warren, were the best communicators. The moderates came with slogans: “Wish-list economics,” Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, said. “Fairy-tale economics,” John Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, said. Warren shot back: “I don’t understand why anyone goes to all the trouble of running for President of the United States to tell us what we can’t do and shouldn’t fight for.”\n\nWarren sounded different from the other candidates: her imagery was more specific. She told the story of Ady Barkan, a health-coverage activist, who is dying of A.L.S. and who has insurance that does not cover his bills. Warren said, “He talks about what it’s like to go online, with thousands of others, to beg friends, family, and strangers” for cash. Her language was alive. The rigged system had not just propped up the wealthy and connected but “kicked dirt in the face of everyone else.” The insurance companies have “sucked billions out of the health-care system” and stored them as profits. “We aren’t going to solve the problem by being the party of small ideas and spinelessness,” she said. “We’re going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big, structural change.” It was hard for anyone to find a comeback to that.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d41a43e0b6ca30008d9abef]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe luck of the draw meant that none of the more moderate candidates on the stage could match Sanders’s or Warren’s profile. Even [Beto O’Rourke](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/beto-o'rourke) and [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/pete-buttigieg) seemed a little shy about drawing distinctions with the two contenders to their left. Often they sounded merely like paler versions of them. Did O’Rourke believe that the government should fund tuition-free four-year college? “I support free two-year college,” he said. But, when he tried to criticize Sanders’s and Warren’s Medicare for All plan, which would eliminate private health insurance, he couldn’t quite bring himself to name his rivals: “The two senators to my right,” he said. Buttigieg got a loud burst of applause for saying, “If we embrace a far-left agenda, the Republicans will call us a bunch of crazy socialists. But, if we embrace a centrist agenda, they will call us a bunch of crazy socialists.” It was a good line. But he was making Sanders’s point for him.\n\nA half hour before the debate started, the Greater Detroit Democratic Socialists of America marched along Woodward Avenue, carrying banners and signs bearing the D.S.A.’s red rose and calling for the Green New Deal. In [the midterm elections](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018), Democratic candidates won votes in moderate suburban districts across the country, and with them a broad national majority, by effectively portraying the Republicans as radicals—the party of Obamacare repeal and child separation—and themselves as defenders of the way that things had been. The simple news tonight was that Warren moved the Democrats a bit further from the party of the 2018 midterms, and a bit closer to the activists in the streets. The subtler development was that she altered the direction of the progressive left, so that it no longer pointed so directly at a utopian socialism but to the oppositional work of what she called “big, structural change.” That’s the revolution now.

It was ten minutes before any candidate spoke, and a half hour had gone by before the opening statements were over and an actual question was introduced. What followed were two hours during which the lefty front-runners on the stage—[Bernie Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders) and [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elizabeth-warren)—beat back chippy attacks from the half-dozen moderate challengers around them. John Delaney, a centrist former congressman whose idea of good news these days is a poll that finds him at one per cent support, must be thrilled with how the night went. CNN’s moderators kept finding ways to bring him into the discussion. In fact, the first question of the night, which CNN’s Jake Tapper put to Sanders, was, “What do you say to Congressman Delaney?” \n\nRather than challenge Sanders and Warren (and [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/pete-buttigieg)) to debate their differences, CNN opted to make it a night of front-runners versus long shots. For the latter—Delaney, Tim Ryan, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Steve Bullock, and [Marianne Williamson](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/at-the-democratic-debate-marianne-williamson-battles-the-dark-psychic-force)—Tuesday was perhaps the last chance to generate a breakthrough to keep their campaigns alive. CNN made the most of their desperation. Bullock, the governor of Montana, got dragged into an argument with Warren about nuclear weapons in which he got so worked up that he wound up calling for a return to “nuclear proliferation,” before correcting himself and calling for “de-proliferation.” Bullock announced his candidacy late—in May—and just managed to qualify for this debate. Surely, nuclear-weapons policy wasn’t the issue he wanted to discuss. \n\nThe value of objectivity has been questioned in many corners of American journalism in recent years. Debate moderation—as high-profile and consequential a task as it is—has remained a redoubt of the classic, view-from-nowhere style. On Tuesday, CNN’s moderators—Tapper, Dana Bash, and Don Lemon—betrayed no opinions except a desire to make it personal. Tapper asked Hickenlooper, “I’d like to hear what you say about Senator Warren’s suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of Medicare for All lack the political will to fight for it.” Bash asked Klobuchar, “Who on the stage is making promises just to get elected?”  \n\nHealth care got three-quarters of an hour, though the discussion mostly focussed on taxes for the middle class. Then the candidates were rushed through foreign policy, gun control, trade, and climate change. The trade discussion offered glimmers of substance, but the nuclear-weapons exchange between Warren and Bullock segued into a discussion about the age of the candidates. The moderators were sticklers, repeatedly interrupting the candidates, reminding them to follow “the rules,” which on Tuesday meant one-minute answers, fifteen-second rebuttals, and fifteen additional seconds “if a moderator asks for a clarification.” Nominally, the candidates agreed to these rules in the interest of order. In practice, the rules mostly served to speed up the drama.\n\nThere will be debates every month until the primaries start, and some experimentation with format is coming. Both CNN and MSNBC [are planning](https://grist.org/article/msnbc-and-cnn-to-host-climate-events-for-the-presidential-candidates/) climate-change “forums” or “town halls” with the candidates—the word “debate” is jealously guarded by the Democratic National Committee, which declined to host a climate-change forum of its own. These events hold the promise of being looser and more expansive than what was broadcast on Tuesday night. They will be welcome.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1f2281ab3335f580f3ad","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Debates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"debates"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92bc86f2c9a244a01","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"CNN","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cnn"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-party"},{"id":"5c2e1c774a08312cd3aa6c36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elizabeth Warren","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elizabeth-warren"},{"id":"5c2e1ca122d4972cd5b832be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bernie Sanders","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bernie-sanders"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a69d2e2e17730741c68c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Eric Lach writes and edits [The Current](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current), *The New Yorker’s* online news and current-events column.

People discussing what will become known as the Gilroy Garlic Festival massacre, which occurred on Sunday afternoon, took solace in the fact that only three victims were killed, until it was discovered that two of them were children, one just six years old. It’s as though, in some obscene way, there’s an implicit horror-score to be computed each time. \n\nThis gun massacre, however, occurred just after the death, on July 16th, of the retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. There were many reasons to praise Justice Stevens, among them his genuinely judicious temperament, his capacity for reasoned argument, his respect for logic and evidence, and his allergy to dogmatic insistence of all kinds—all virtues that have been fading during the past decade of judicial polarization, and are now being aggressively eradicated under Trumpism. But perhaps his finest single legacy is his dissent—which may come to seem as distinguished as any in American history—to the genuinely deranged 2008 Supreme Court decision on gun laws in District of Columbia v. Heller. Concerning a near total ban on handguns in Washington, D.C., it was decided by a 5–4 vote, led by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, which interpreted the Second Amendment to recognize a civilian’s right to keep a firearm unconnected to a “well regulated” militia. (Traditionally, significant decisions on the Supreme Court had to command significant majorities and otherwise lacked legitimacy. Brown v. Board of Education was a unanimous decision; Roe v. Wade decided on a 7–2 majority. Nowadays, precedents and, indeed, Presidents can be forced through with a one-vote majority, no matter the long-term cost to the legitimacy of the court. We have not yet meditated sufficiently, perhaps, on how aberrant that practice ought to be considered.)     \n\nScalia’s reasoning in Heller hardly deserves the name. Neither the clear words nor the transparent intentions of the Constitution’s authors were taken up; instead, Scalia showed that you could, with effort, construe the words of the Second Amendment to mean something clearly different from what they had ever been understood to mean. His opinion involved suppositions about words and meanings as incredible to any meaningful philosophy of language as they are to any meaningful philosophy of law.  \n\nStevens, in his dissent, wrote that an attempt to offer such a reading in the context of the Second Amendment is particularly risible, since no piece of American law could be more clearly contoured by a social purpose. As he writes, dryly demolishing the key argument in the majority opinion, “The [Second Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentii) was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp; Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature’s authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.” \n\nStevens’s opinion is not just a persuasive legal argument but also a model of pragmatic reasoning. He patiently takes apart the claims of the majority, disassembling them piece by piece, like—well, like a man disassembling a weapon—and reasserts, past all reasonable counter-argument, that there is nothing in the Constitution to protect gun makers and gun killers from being disarmed in advance by their fellow-citizens. It was a logical argument in a losing cause, but it still stands, upright and unashamed, as the only logical argument that the case at hand could provoke. \n\nStevens’s dissent is particularly relevant now, because, once again, and with even more force, not only the urgency but the efficacy of gun control has become self-evident, and the case that gun control is constitutional needs to be made once again. The evidence all along has been that the presence of many guns correlates with the epidemic of gun massacres. New studies, including [one published last year](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/11/lax-state-gun-laws-linked-to-more-child-teen-gun-deaths.html), by the Stanford University School of Medicine, and [another published this month](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/health/children-gun-deaths-strict-gun-laws-study-trnd/index.html), in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, reinforce what ought to be the unremarkable point that states with stronger gun laws see fewer children dying of gunshots. “If you put more regulations on firearms, it does make a difference,” Stephanie Chao, an assistant professor of surgery at Stanford, said. “It does end up saving children’s lives.” (It is no surprise that surgeons, who see children devastated by bullets, are often the originators of these studies.)\n\nThis spring, an [appropriations bill](https://giffords.org/2019/04/gun-violence-research-house-appropriations-intro/) passed the House which authorizes fifty million dollars in spending for the seemingly small cause of investigating the causes and cures of gun violence. This is a pursuit that, in a fully rational country, would need no pursuing—or would have been long pursued—but, given that all such research has been prohibited from receiving federal funding for more than twenty years, it’s a significant advance. As an editorial in [*Scientific American*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-u-s-congress-has-started-to-revive-gun-violence-research-mdash-and-must-follow-through/) puts it, none of the recent smaller-scale studies “has had the power of large investigations that look at the effects of various kinds of interventions across the entire country and that involve tens of thousands of people. This is the kind of science that showed us the safety and health advantages of using seat belts, quitting smoking and reducing air pollution.” \n\nSo, when the Democratic candidates on the debate stage this week, in Detroit, are asked about gun massacres and gun control, as they will be, they need to do three things. First, they should endorse the House bill and even ask that the sums involved be increased. Second, they need to offer counsel against despair, even in the face of the staunch Republican resistance that will surely rise in the Senate regarding this mild investigative initiative. The reason that we know as much as we do about gun violence is that state-by-state legislation that has already been passed is saving lives. That smaller-scale legislation isn’t enough; the gun for this latest massacre in California, which has strict laws, was bought in Nevada, [which does not](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/07/gilroy-garlic-festival-california-nevada/). But we ought to promote making guns harder to obtain in as many towns, cities, and states as we can, even if we cannot yet entirely nationalize gun sanity. It makes a difference.  \n\nAnd the candidates should not be afraid of taking “radical” positions. One lesson—however paradoxically it must be learned from the astounding reversal of long-settled law in Heller, and, more broadly, through the unprecedented insistence, over the past thirty or so years, on putting military-style weapons into private hands—is that ideas that were once fringe can be made central, if they are put forward with enough passion and purpose. Incremental change will be a necessary fact of the path to gun sanity. You start somewhere and go farther. We are told over and over that laws banning assault weapons are impossible to pass because there are already so many of the weapons available—and what is an assault weapon, anyway? (That’s actually easy to answer: it’s one designed to imitate military weapons that are designed to kill many people quickly.)  \n\nBut there is no reason to let difficulty be the enemy of the determination. We’ve heard long enough about “background checks” and gun-show loopholes. It’s time for politicians to speak up for an outright and permanent ban on assault weapons, and subsequent bans on the handguns that are the cause of many more deaths. Every study and every survey shows that the overwhelming body of the American people are in favor of gun sanity. The example of Justice Stevens’s life involves the power of rational argument to endure in all its integrity, even in the face of obvious madness. The candidates should remember that, as Stevens showed, you can argue rationally for a passionate purpose, and passionately for a rational one. Doing that is exactly why we have politics.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Guns","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass

(“How wofully the reverse is the case with systems of philosophy,” he added.) We prefer collections of aphorisms over big books of philosophy, Mill thought, not just because the contents are always short and usually funny but because the aphorism is, in its algebraic abbreviation, a micro-model of empirical inquiry. Mill noted that “to be unsystematic is of the essence of all truths which rest on specific experiment,” and that there is, in a good aphorism, “generally truth, or a bold approach to some truth.” So when La Rochefoucauld writes, “In the misfortune of even our best friends, there is something that does not displease us,” he is offering not a moral injunction saying “Take pleasure in the misfortune of your best friends” but a testable observation about what Mill termed “the workings of habitual selfishness in the human breast.” The aphorism means: We do take pleasure—not in every case, perhaps, but more often than we might admit—in the misfortune of our best friends.\n\nWe don’t absorb aphorisms as esoteric wisdom; we test them against our own experience. The empirical test of the aphorism takes the form first of laughter and then of longevity, and its confidential tone makes it candid, not cynical. Aphorisms live because they contain human truth, as Mill saw, and reach across barriers of class and era. “Old men delight in giving good advice as a consolation for the fact that they can no longer set bad examples,” another La Rochefoucauld classic, is not only humorous in its tidy reversal; it is also still rather persuasive, as we watch the drift from rebelliousness to reaction in every generation.\n\nAphorisms come at us in so many forms and from so many periods that one might think an academic study of aphorisms would aim to give them a family tree—tracing the emergence of the humanistic aphorism from its solemn white-bearded grandfather, the proverb; the descent of the clever, provocative epigram from its sly guerrilla progenitor, the parable (the form that allowed Jesus to spread subversion while seeming merely obscurely elegant). And then we might learn how those later forms have spawned such contemporary commercial descendants as the one-liner and the meme.\n\nBut Andrew Hui’s new study, “[A Theory of the Aphorism: From Confucius to Twitter](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Aphorism-Confucius-Twitter/dp/0691188955)” (Princeton), does something oddly and interestingly different. The kind of witty generalization about human behavior that Mill considers an aphorism to be is largely absent from Hui’s book. (So is Mill’s essay on aphorisms.) On the whole, Hui condescends to the epigram of manners, and to what we normally think of as the golden age of aphorisms, the seventeenth century in France, whose writings he finds marked by “the frothy ambience of elite social networks.” Instead, the history he has written is devoted to something more like what we usually call “sayings”—as in the sayings of the Buddha in the Dhammapada or the sayings of Confucius in the Analects, not the burnished bon mot but the fragmentary and often cryptic utterances of oracles, gurus, and rabbis. Still, buy the premise and you’ll enjoy the bit, as David Letterman, an aphorist of sorts himself, used to say. Once the reader accepts this more expansive and sombre definition of the aphorism, much of interest follows, written in that dense, allusive, and largely non-aphoristic style which is called good writing in academia. (Not that it isn’t good writing of a kind; it is, of a kind.)\n\n“Philosophies come and go, theologies rise and fall, but the aphorism abides,” Hui announces. His heroic aphoristic arc takes us not from the chilly La Rochefoucauld to the witty Wilde but from the elliptical Pascal to the gnomic Nietzsche, both of whom encrypted their philosophies in brief bursts of memorable obscurity. The arc ends with modernist figures such as Cioran and Calvino, who are at once oracles and comedians. Hui even poses, a little apologetically, the question: Are tweets anything like the classic aphorism? It’s a version of the cultural journalist’s favorite question, “What has Twitter done to our minds and lives?,” and—though it will look quaint thirty years from now, just as the endless fussing about the meaning of music videos and Atari games in the nineteen-eighties looks quaint today—it is one that the Twitter-afflicted are bound to wonder about.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMill and Hui do converge on the right question, though: Why is spiritual wisdom found in fragmentary form more reliably than in extended dogma? Why is it that the sayings last, even when their systematic surroundings don’t? We know Jesus’ parables better than we do the doctrine of the Trinity, though the latter is far more central to Christianity, just as we know Zen monks’ koans better than Zen monastery practices. Even Socrates’ wisdom comes down to us in recorded counterpunches. The primal situation of the religious life is not the hermit writing down his revelations in a tower but the master speaking fragmentary truths to a circle of startled students with pencils. The aphoristic saying falls from the teacher’s lips, and gets written down and repeated and then shared. (Many of these must have been retrospectively created—some of the general sayings ascribed to Jesus may have been drawn from a reservoir of common wisdoms.)\n\nMill’s scientific-minded answer is that we recognize the aphorism, with its immediacy, its turn toward tangible experience, as the preferable alternative to dogma. That’s why we have Jesus giving us parables of sowers and mustard seeds, of houses built on sand and stone, rather than explanations of how he might be God and man and spirit all at once.\n\nThe anthropological answer is that, although we normally think of religions as sets of absolute rules, an ambivalent enigma is actually a more practical tool for spreading the faith, since it can mean many things to many people. What did Confucius mean when he remarked on the ceaseless flow of a river? Something pessimistic (since the flow of time is unstoppable, don’t ever think you can master it), or something optimistic (the advance of things can’t be impeded)? Well, it can mean more or less what you like; great religious and ethical sayings, unlike great religious systems, tend to be roomy enough to accommodate many readings. They are the escape clause written into the contract with God.\n\nThe more mystical appraisal of the aphorism is that the fragment captures all we can hope to see of the divine. Our universe and the God within it are too big to be systematized; we see Him or Her most clearly in glimpses, the way that ants see humans. The hero of Hui’s story, aptly, is an apostle of this view, the seventeenth-century French mathematician and mystic Blaise Pascal. Pascal’s _non finito_ manner, with little brought to a conclusion, is not an unfortunate failure but a deliberate defiance of Cartesian system-building. The illogic of one cryptic fragment colliding with the next cryptic fragment vindicates soul over system. (Max Beerbohm once suggested, in this spirit, that Sappho’s work doesn’t survive in fragments but was _written_ in fragments.) Pascal’s great aphorism “The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing” announces a purposeful romanticism of small parts, which don’t have to cohere to vibrate.\n\nThe taste for the partial as an indictment of specious ambition is carried over to Pascal’s great successor, the nineteenth-century German aphorist Nietzsche, for whom the fragment was also a way of thumbing his nose at big thinkers with finished philosophies. Nietzsche saw a direct connection between his leaps of faith, or non-faith, and the aphoristic form, writing, “In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak: but for that one must have long legs. Aphorisms should be peaks—and those who are addressed, tall and lofty.” As with Greek temples, so with philosophies: the fascination of the fragment, seen up close, leads to the pathos of the ruin, seen from a distance.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIs the aphorism—empirical or mystical, funny or fragmentary—a living form? For much of the past century, we would have answered no, but suddenly we seem to be living through a revival of the aphorism as a self-sufficient thing. The Scottish poet Don Paterson has published three justly praised books made up of nothing but. Among his best: “It’s monstrous to think of our parents having sex, because we then have to think of them conceiving _us_ . . . Hard enough to live with the exile without replaying the scene of the eviction”; “A poem with one line wrong is like a Rubik’s Cube with one square wrong: what it is precisely _not_ is one move away from completion”; “Amazing that the chess clock never found a more general application. A more enlightened society would have made it as indispensable to conversation as shoes to walking.”\n\nContemporary in style, Paterson’s aphorisms still have a taint of the past. The human sciences are all too human, and one of the truths is that the self-assured heterosexual aphorism—the confident statement about the nature of the “love of women” and so on (“In some Neanderthal part of me, every husband poses an affront” is one of Paterson’s)—has to ring a leper’s bell these days, and wear shaming scare quotes, not to mention brackets. Since a generalization about life is also, invariably, a half-truth about it, the missing half of the truth often registers more clangingly now than the half that’s there.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d265e4f2aea2c00091d88fd]||||||\n+++\n\nAnd Paterson, as a stylist, can also go one beat too far.\n\n> The poorest are denied their nostalgias by their social immobility. Their primal territories are the ones they still inhabit. Their sweetest memories are all ungeographic.\n\nseems more effective without the last sentence. The wonderful\n\n> Almost everything in the room will survive you. To the room, you are _already_ a ghost, a pathetic soft thing, coming and going.\n\nwould end better at “ghost.”\n\nBut it may be that this kind of slightly ragged, expansive, narrative aphorism is the true aphorism of the modern era. E. M. Cioran, the Pascalian French-Romanian aphorist and insomniac, who wrote volumes of them and seems to be Paterson’s model, could produce lines that were straightforward and concise: “One can experience loneliness in two ways: by feeling lonely in the world or by feeling the loneliness of the world.” But more often they were discursive, short moments of rumination rather than neat sentences of certainty: “There is no other world. Nor even this one. What, then, is there? The inner smile provoked in us by the patent nonexistence of both.”\n\nCertainly, the Australian aphorist [James Guida](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/james-guida) seems at his very best when he writes long: “Nobody need leave their bathroom to taste the ‘big’ truths. To know that all in life must end, consider this disgusting shower curtain; that nature is full of magical renewal, see this tube of toothpaste, which with one more squeeze proves again that its contents are infinite; that social life occasionally means warfare with fast-scurrying villains—I refer you to this cockroach.” This kind of aphorism fills the space left not only by the epigram but by the epistles once exchanged by friends with time to be funny.\n\nAnd so, by this process, the aphorism properly so called is by now backing up into its cousin, aphoristic prose, which certainly has kept a living presence in criticism and reviewing. It may be that all the aphoristic kinds—from the blunt saying to the polished epigram—run together in critical prose, where they are weapons in the struggle rather than heads mounted on the wall. Aphoristic prose is to the true, pure aphorism what storytelling is to standup comedy: easier to do because less dependent on a single explosive response. Even if the aphorism doesn’t quite work, the ideas around it still get communicated. The best writers of aphoristic prose—G. K. Chesterton, Clive James—use the aphorism as comic relief on the climb, more than as the summit itself.\n\nWhat of Twitter? “Brevity is the soul of wit,” Shakespeare’s Polonius says, issuing the greatest unintentional aphorism in literature: at the time, scholars say, the line meant merely that concision is the essence of useful intelligence, and, of course, it was uttered as part of a deliberately long-winded speech. But it now captures—by the accident of the evolution of English, such that “wit” now means humor—a subtler truth: a joke is improved by compression. Twitter, in its imposed brevity, seems to affirm the aphorism’s original meaning: be intelligently succinct!\n\nBeing succinct without being funny often produces the effect of merely being mean. The Internet meme entertains because of its predictability, resting on the common expectations of the crowd. The dog in the burning house, the face palm, the man settling in to eat popcorn and watch the spectacle: these things are buoyed by the familiarity of their occurrence. Social media seems less good at wit, in either sense, than at running jokes—like the closet in the radio show “Fibber McGee and Molly” (to go a long, long way back), whose contents regularly spilled out when the door was opened. The fun, more often than not, lies not in surprise but in knowing exactly what will happen before it does.\n\nThe aphorism, in the course of history, can be taken as the epitome of the rational or the epitome of the irrational. It can be compressed and self-contained wisdom, or it can be a broken fragment designed to show that ours is an already shattered world. But, whatever it is, it’s always an epitome, and seeks an essence. The ability to elide the extraneous is what makes the aphorism bite, but the possibility of inferring backward to a missing text is what makes the aphorism poetic. We are told that, in reading, context is everything, but the aphorism reminds us that there is joy, too, in the freedom from context. We don’t ask which of La Rochefoucauld’s friends made him jealous—the thought lands independent of its circumstance. Oscar Wilde’s best epigrams are usually funnier when taken away from the designated speakers in his plays. Aphorisms supply the same kind of pleasure as the first morning on a new island—a reprieve from feeling too deeply embedded in a time or place. Where big books remind us of how hard the work of understanding can be, aphorisms remind us of how little we have to know to get the point. Sayings see what systems can’t. ♦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d842396212cbb9fca8e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Aphorisms","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"aphorisms"},{"id":"5c2e1c8681ab3335f580f180","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Poets","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"poets"},{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e3095e56e652c90274b56","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"John Stuart Mill","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"john-stuart-mill"}],"sections":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ff4b1c7a8e33fb390bbb","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 1986.

The slow way is the familiar one: decades pass with little sense of internal change, middle age arrives with only a slight slowing down—a name lost, a lumbar ache, a sprinkling of white hairs and eye wrinkles. The fast way happens as a series of lurches: eyes occlude, hearing dwindles, a hand trembles where it hadn’t, a hip breaks—the usually hale and hearty doctor’s murmur in the yearly checkup, _There are some signs here that concern me_.\n\nTo get a sense of what it would be like to have the slow process become the fast process, you can go to the AgeLab, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, and put on *agnes*{: .small} (for Age Gain Now Empathy System). *agnes*{: .small}, or the “sudden aging” suit, as Joseph Coughlin, the founder and director of the AgeLab describes it, includes yellow glasses, which convey a sense of the yellowing of the ocular lens that comes with age; a boxer’s neck harness, which mimics the diminished mobility of the cervical spine; bands around the elbows, wrists, and knees to simulate stiffness; boots with foam padding to produce a loss of tactile feedback; and special gloves to “reduce tactile acuity while adding resistance to finger movements.”\n\nSlowly pulling on the aging suit and then standing up—it looks a bit like one of the spacesuits that the Russian cosmonauts wore—you’re at first conscious merely of a little extra weight, a little loss of feeling, a small encumbrance or two at the extremities. Soon, though, it’s actively infuriating. The suit bends you. It slows you. You come to realize what makes it a powerful instrument of emotional empathy: every small task becomes effortful. “Reach up to the top shelf and pick up that mug,” Coughlin orders, and doing so requires more attention than you expected. You reach for the mug instead of just getting it. Your emotional cast, as focussed task piles on focussed task, becomes one of annoyance; you acquire the same set-mouthed, unhappy, watchful look you see on certain elderly people on the subway. The concentration that each act requires disrupts the flow of life, which you suddenly become aware is the happiness of life, the ceaseless flow of simple action and responses, choices all made simultaneously and mostly without effort. Happiness is absorption, and absorption is the opposite of willful attention.\n\nThe annoyance, after a half hour or so in the suit, tips over into anger: _Damn, what’s wrong with the world_? (Never: What’s wrong with me?) The suit makes us aware not so much of the physical difficulties of old age, which can be manageable, but of the mental state disconcertingly associated with it—the price of age being perpetual aggravation. The theme and action and motive of [King Lear](https://www.amazon.com/King-Lear-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/074348276X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=king+lear&qid=1557761735&s=books&sr=1-2) suddenly become perfectly clear. You become enraged at your youngest daughter’s reticence because you have had to struggle to unroll the map of your kingdom.\n\nThe AgeLab is designed to alleviate this progression. It exists to encourage and incubate new technologies and products and services for an ever-larger market of aging people. (“Every eight seconds, a baby boomer turns seventy-three,” Coughlin observes.) Coughlin, who is in his late fifties, is the image of an old-fashioned American engineer-entrepreneur; he is bald in the old-fashioned, tonsured, Thurber-husband way, wears a bow tie and heavy red-framed glasses, and, walking a visitor through the lab, suggests a cross between Mr. Peabody and Q, from the Bond films, showing you the latest gadgets. His talk is crisply aphoristic and irrigated with an easy flow of statistics: each proposition has its instantly associated number.\n\n“Where science is ambiguous, politics begins,” he says. “In the designation of some states, an older driver is fifty, in some eighty—we don’t even know what an older driver is. That ambiguity is an itch I wanted to scratch. Over the past century, we’ve created the greatest gift in the history of humanity—thirty extra years of life—and we don’t know what to do with it! Now that we’re living longer, how do we plan for what we’re going to do?”\n\nHaving picked the mug up, the suit wearer finds that setting the mug down gently on a nearby table is also a bit of a challenge. So is following Coughlin from room to room as he narrates all that the AgeLab has learned.\n\n“Here’s a useful model for you,” he says. “From zero to twenty-one is about eight thousand days. From twenty-one to midlife crisis is eight thousand days. From mid-forties to sixty-five—eight thousand days. Nowadays, if you make it to sixty-five you have a fifty-per-cent chance you’ll make it to eighty-five. Another eight thousand days! That’s no longer a trip to Disney and wait for the grandchildren to visit and die of the virus you get on a cruise. We’re talking about rethinking, redefining one-third of adult life! The greatest achievement in the history of humankind—and all we can say is that it’s going to make [Medicare](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/medicare) go broke? Why don’t we take that one-third and create new stories, new rituals, new mythologies for people as they age?”\n\nThe *agnes*{: .small} suit is one of many instruments and appliances—or “cool toys,” as they are more technically known—that can be found in the AgeLab’s glass-walled halls and cubicled corridors, ready to entertain visiting writers, and to instruct visiting entrepreneurs. There is the driving simulator, specially fitted to track the driver’s eye movements as they flit back and forth from the dashboard to the horizon. (“With its new technologies, like navigation systems, the automotive industry is asking people to change fifty years of driving habits in ten minutes without instruction,” Coughlin says.) There is Paro, a robotic baby seal, from Japan, which bleats and moves its head, and is designed to act as a comfort to aging people, particularly Alzheimer’s patients struggling with the “sundown” moment at day’s end, when confusion and restlessness become acute. (“It’s a seal, rather than a dog or a cat, because people have great experiences with dogs and cats, and even Alzheimer’s patients can spot the eerie non-resemblance,” Coughlin says. “Having no experience of seals, we accept Paro as he is.”) There are mobile robotic nurses made for elderly care, and broad red upholstered chairs made for elderly rears. There are large research displays showing photographs of drivers, their faces embedded with sensors, and the varieties of “Glance Classification” that can, when analyzed, lead to “Crash Avoidance.” (“The ratio between confident decisions and _correct_ confident decisions can be a story of life or death on the highway,” Coughlin explains.) And there are displays of word clouds associated with aging, showing the significant difference between the terms with which women imagine their post-career lives (Freedom, Time, Family) and those which men use (Retirement, Relax, Hobbies).\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe work of the AgeLab is shaped by a paradox. Having been established to engineer and promote new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged, the AgeLab swiftly discovered that engineering and promoting new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged is a good way of going out of business. Old people will not buy anything that reminds them that they are old. They are a market that cannot be marketed to. In effect, to accept help in getting out of the suit is to accept that we’re in the suit for life. We would rather suffer because we’re old than accept that we’re old and suffer less.\n\nThis paradox is, well, old. Heinz, back in the nineteen-fifties, tried marketing a line of “Senior Foods” that was, essentially, baby food for old people. It not only failed spectacularly but, as Coughlin puts it, poisoned an entire category. The most perverse of these failures is perhaps that of the *PERS*{: .small}, or personal-emergency-response system, a category of device—best known for the hysterically toned television ad in which an elderly woman calls out, “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!”—designed as a neck pendant that summons emergency services when pressed. It is simple and effective. “The problem is that no one wants one,” Coughlin says. “The entire penetration in the U.S. of the sixty-five-plus market is less than four per cent. And a German study showed that, when subscribers fell and remained on the floor for longer than five minutes, they failed to use their devices to summon help eighty-three per cent of the time.” In other words, many older people would sooner thrash on the floor in distress than press a button—one that may summon assistance but whose real impact is to admit, _I am old_.\n\n“We buy products not just to do jobs but for what they say about us,” Coughlin summarizes. “Beige or light-blue bracelets or pendants say ‘Old Man Walking.’ ”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d]||||||\n+++\n\nThe AgeLab has rediscovered the eternal truth that identity matters to us far more than utility. The most effective way of comforting the aged, the researchers there find, is through a kind of comical convergence of products designed by and supposedly for impatient millennials, which secretly better suit the needs of irascible boomers. The best hearing aids look the most like earbuds. The most effective *PERS*{: .small} device is an iPhone or an Apple Watch app.\n\nSuch unexpected convergences have happened in the past. Retirement villages came to be centered on golf courses, Coughlin maintains, not because oldsters necessarily like golf but because they like using golf carts. It’s the carts that supply greater mobility in and around the village. The golf comes with them. This process of “exaptation” has now accelerated. TaskRabbit and Uber and Rent the Runway—services that provide immediate help for specific problems—are especially valuable for an aging population.\n\n“The dominant paradigm is that older people don’t want new technology,” Coughlin says. “But take the microwave oven! It couldn’t have been better designed for people who live by themselves. It’s a perfect example of what I call ‘transcendent design’—not made for older people, but ideal for them. We’re doing a lot of work in the on-demand economy, which was made for millennials but is working better for boomers. Meals are delivered—these are amazing, assisted-living services that can come to anyone’s house. Older women in particular are saved from microdeficiencies in their diet. So, while the millennials want them for convenience, the boomers want them for care for their parents, or themselves.”\n\nCoughlin hates what he calls “the narrative,” according to which new tech appeals to newer people: “Startup money goes to youngsters because that’s what startup entrepreneurs are supposed to look like, and the products are designed for kids because that’s what startup products are meant to look like.” In his view—detailed in his book “[The Longevity Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Economy-Unlocking-Fastest-Growing-Misunderstood/dp/1610396634/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Longevity+Economy&qid=1557761623&s=books&sr=1-1)”—the narrative, more than any rational calculation of profit, accounts for the technological gap. “There’s no reason for this enormous prejudice in favor of youthfulness in Silicon Valley and the tech industry,” he says. He also hates the misallocation of resources based on mere myths. “We have a belief that we send out our elderly to institutions. The fact of the matter is that less than ten per cent of the elderly go into nursing homes or assisted living. The senior-housing industry is building inventory meant for seniors, but eighty-seven per cent of retirement-age people want to stay in the same home where they have the three ‘M’s: marriage, mortgage, and memories. The problem is that they can’t. Not when the model is a two-story house with a bedroom and the bathroom upstairs. If we can solve the stairs problem, we won’t need new housing.”\n\nCoughlin says that having simple answers to two questions can determine whether you’re going to age well in place: “Who’s going to change the light bulb, and how are you going to get an ice-cream cone? Little tasks become sources of high friction. It’s not that you can’t climb the ladder to change the light bulb. But for the first time you are going to have someone yelling at you, ‘You’re going to fall and break your neck!’ That’s the problem of aging we have to tackle, not building more old people’s homes or senior villages.” It’s the failure of industry and engineering to address the actual problems of aging—the problems summed up by the aggravations of the *agnes*{: .small} suit—that makes Coughlin impatient with scientific speculations about extending life. “We’ve already extended life! What we need is not to put off death a little longer but to write a new narrative of aging as it could be.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAging has no point; it is the infuriating absence of a point. Having reproduced ourselves externally, we fall down on replicating ourselves internally. The processes of cellular replication that allow us to be boats rebuilt even as they cross the ocean cease acting efficiently, because they have no evolutionary reward for acting efficiently. They are like code monkeys in a failing tech business: they can mess up everything, absent-mindedly forget to code for the color of our hair or the elasticity of our skin, and no penalty is exacted for the failure. We’ve already made all the kids we are going to make.\n\nThat, at least, is the classic explanation of why we age, proposed by the British Nobel laureate Peter Medawar, in the nineteen-fifties. Once we have passed reproductive age, the genes can get sloppy about copying, allowing mutations to accumulate, because natural selection no longer cares. And so things fall apart. The second law of thermodynamics gets us all in the end. The car or the Cuisinart works for a decade, breaks down, and can’t be fixed; rust never sleeps, and we do.\n\nAnd yet some trees go on for centuries, collecting rings, growing older without really aging. Some species—though those are often hard-to-track creatures, like Arctic sharks—may live for centuries. Even if aging at some speed is ultimately inevitable, what happens when we age is far from self-evident.\n\nIt may be that the real trick is not how much we age but how much we don’t. Human beings are outliers: we live much longer than other creatures of our size, defying the general truth that smaller animals live shorter lives than bigger ones. (Not that we should take too much pride in our defiance; another great defier is the naked mole rat, the world’s ugliest animal, which often lives for absurdly long periods and scarcely seems to age at all, although one might ask how anyone but another naked mole rat could tell.) Those extra thirty years of life, though won by advances in medicine and public health, are winnable because, given a little chance, we just go on. The big question of human aging then becomes not why we fall apart but why nature lets us hold together for so long.\n\nOne evolutionary rationale is that there is something essential to human groups, with the slowly unfolding infancy of their young, in keeping the old folks around even when they can’t make more young folks. Old folks are repositories of extended cultural memory: it would seem to be advantageous to have a few senior citizens around who know what to do, so to speak, when winter comes. Evolutionary biologists tend to doubt whether nature cares about the fitness of groups, rather than the fitness of individuals, but the model of “kin selection”—which gives weight to the fact that helping my relatives helps preserve my genes—suggests that there might be evolutionary advantages in having grandmothers around to take care of kids and remember where the fish go every twenty years. (Then again, people who do have grandparents around to remind them what they’re doing wrong would probably suspect that killing off the oldsters early might actually make for more success, or at least more serenity.) People might not have a death sentence in their genes.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAnd so elsewhere in Cambridge, notably in certain genetic labs at Harvard, the chairs and seals and exaptated services of the AgeLab are regarded as mere Band-Aids on the problem to be solved. Here, there are whispers of undying yeast, tales of eternally young mice, rumors of rejuvenated dogs, and scientists who stubbornly insist that age is an illness to be treated like any other.\n\nWhere fifty years ago it was taken for granted that the problem of age was a problem of the inevitable running down of everything, entropy working its worst, now many researchers are inclined to think that the problem is “epigenetic”: it’s a problem in reading the information—the genetic code—in the cells. To use a metaphor of the Harvard geneticist David Sinclair, the information in each cell is digital and perfectly stored; it’s the “readout,” the active expression of the information, that’s effectively analogue, and subject to occlusion by the equivalent of dirt and scratches on the plastic surface of a CD. Clear those off, he says, and the younger you, still intact in the information layer, jumps out—just as the younger Beatles jump out from a restored and remastered CD. (It would not be the first time in the history of science that the way we think about a phenomenon has been affected by the kinds of man-made models we’re acquainted with. When a telephone switchboard was our most impressive knowledge-bearing mechanism, people thought that the brain was like one; when Xerox copies, growing less legible as generation passed to generation, were familiar to everyone, the image of a cell ceasing to replicate itself effectively in that manner was self-evident.)\n\nWe don’t have to micromanage the repair, the Harvard molecular biologist George Church observes: “If we think epigenetically, we can see that we can make the cells industriously do the repair themselves.” Already a legendary figure for devising genomic-sequencing techniques—it must help that he’s a scientific eminence who has the aura of one, with a grand Darwinian beard and a slow-spoken orotundity—Church gained further attention for his experiments in trying to resurrect extinct species, particularly the woolly mammoth. (One of his standard jokes is that the fifth floor of his lab is off limits to visitors, because that is where the mammoths and the Neanderthals live.) He is also among a group of engineer-entrepreneurs who are trying not to make better products for aging people but to make fewer aging people to sell products to. Perhaps aging is not a condition to be managed but a mistake to be fixed. Sinclair, for one, has successfully extended the life of yeast, and says that he is moving on to human trials. He is an evangelist for the advantages of what he calls “hormesis”—the practice of inducing metabolic stress by short intense exercise or intermittent fasting. “Every day, try to be hungry and out of breath” is his neatly epigenetic epigram.\n\nAnti-aging research, in its “translational,” or applied, form, seems to be proceeding along two main fronts: through “small molecules,” meaning mostly dietary supplements that are intended to rev up the right proteins; and, perhaps more dramatically, through genetic engineering. Typically, genetic engineering involves adding or otherwise manipulating genes in a population of animals, often mice, perhaps by rejiggering a mouse’s genome in embryo and then using it to breed a genetically altered strain. In mice studies, genetic modifications that cause the rodents to make greater amounts of a single protein, sirtuin 6, have resulted in longer life spans (although some scientists think that the intervention merely helped male mice to live as long as female mice).\n\nChurch and Noah Davidsohn, a former postdoc in his lab, have engaged in a secretive but much talked-about venture to make old dogs new. They have conducted gene therapy on beagles with the Tufts veterinary school, and are currently advertising for Cavalier King Charles spaniels, which are highly prone to an incurable age-related heart condition, mitral-valve disease; almost all of them develop it by the age of ten. Using a genetically modified virus, Church and Davidsohn’s team will insert a piece of DNA into a dog’s liver cells and get them to produce a protein meant to stop the heart disease from progressing. But the team has larger ambitions. It has been identifying other targets for gene-based interventions, studying a database of aging-related genes: genes that are overexpressed or underexpressed—that make too much or too little of a particular protein—as we grow old. In the CD replay of life, these are the notes that get muffled or amplified, and Davidsohn and Church want to restore them to their proper volume.\n\nMany problems cling to this work, not least that there are surprisingly few “bio-markers” of increased longevity. One researcher makes a comparison with cancer research: we know a patient’s cancer has been successfully treated when the cancer cells go away, but how do you know if you’ve made people live longer except by waiting decades and seeing when they die? Ideally, we’d find something that could be measured in a blood test, say, and was reliably correlated with someone’s life span.\n\nChurch is optimistic about the genetic-engineering approach. “We know it can work,” he says, “because we’ve already had success reprogramming embryonic stem cells: you _can_ take a really old cell and turn that back into a young cell. We’re doing it now. Most of the work was done in mice, where we’ve extended the life of mice by a factor of two. It isn’t seen as impressive, because it’s mice, but now we’re working on dogs. There are about nine different pathways that we’ve identified for cell rejuvenation, one of which eliminates senescent cells”—moldering cells that have stopped dividing and tend to spark inflammation, serving as a perpetual irritant to their neighbors.\n\n“We’re already in clinical trials with dogs,” Church says. “If all goes well, we should have that accomplished within two years, and be overlapping that with human clinical trials within the next five years. My guess is that dog trials will go well. Based on the mouse trials, we’re hoping that the effects are general and independent of species—we’re using the same gene therapy in mice and dogs and humans.”\n\nChurch is aware that the Food and Drug Administration, among other regulatory bodies, may not be crazy about weird new therapies that address what we customarily take to be a natural process. “Our emphasis is on reversal rather than longevity, in part because it’s easier to get permission from the F.D.A. for reversal of diseases than for prolongation of life,” he says. “Longevity isn’t our aim—we’re just aiming at the reversal of age-related diseases.” Noah Davidsohn enthusiastically seconds this: “We want to make people live better, not necessarily longer, though obviously longer is part of better.” But Church makes it plain that these are adjoining concerns. “How old can people grow?” he says. “Well, if our approach is truly effective, there is no upper limit. But our goal isn’t eternal life. The goal is youthful wellness rather than an extended long period of age-related decline. You know, one of the striking things is that many super-centenarians”—people who live productively past a hundred years—“live a youthful life, and then they die very quickly. They’re here, living well, and then they’re not. It’s not a bad picture.”\n\nThere are many skeptics among scientists who wonder how much, or how soon, this kind of work will really affect aging. Church gets shares for serving on the advisory board of Elysium Health, which markets an anti-aging supplement called Basis, and though the literature is careful to say that, “rather than endorsing a specific product, this network of scientists, clinicians and health professionals advises the Elysium team on product identification and development,” how one distinguishes between advising on the product and endorsing the product seems to many a bit mystical. Others may recall the enthusiasm, in the early twentieth century, for implanting monkey glands in people, a procedure that was held out as a scientific solution to the problem of aging. (W. B. Yeats had a related procedure.) The fountain of youth is always splashing away somewhere.\n\nBehind the optimistic promise of heading off aging in spaniels and, soon, in their owners lies a sadder reality: that even foundational research cannot always cure a fundamental problem. Despite what had seemed to be groundbreaking discoveries in the basic genetics and pathology of dementia, no cure or even promising treatment for senility, as it once was called, is in sight. Increasing numbers of people enter old age not merely reduced but ravaged by Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, now epidemic in the richer countries that have greater life expectancies. Old Lear’s primary fear is not of age but of madness, which he imagines precisely as dementia: as the loss of mental control, of memory, and of cognition, seeing his fate mirrored in that of Poor Tom, the ranting homeless man impersonated by Edgar.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nTo pass from the Harvard rejuvenators to the laboratory of Patrick Hof, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in Manhattan, is to sober up a little. Here, there is talk not of imminent innovation but of discouragingly minute work proceeding on many slow-moving fronts over decades. Where the Harvard crowd see quick fixes in the near future, Hof, an expert on the neuronal underpinnings of aging and Alzheimer’s, sees the exposure of ever more confounding complexity.\n\nHis tenth-floor office is filled with reproductions of Blake illuminations and Whistler portraits, while photographs of his children cycle on the screen saver behind him, blended with images of whales and dolphins, a particular interest of his. His nearby lab is an open space with small chapels off it, in which researchers—postdocs, junior faculty, skilled technicians—study the youthful and aged brains of many kinds of animals, with what looks like every kind of microscope: smaller viewing ones, mid-sized high-resolution ones, and a single massive electron-scanning microscope that lets his researchers see neural structure down to a dendrite’s tiny terminal spines.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f]||||||\n+++\n\n“My career started at the beginning of digital microscopy,” Hof says. He is white-haired, with the soft accent of his native Switzerland. “Now we can collect terabytes of data—we can collect entire networks of neurons within a single animal brain. We do tissue staining, taking a piece of brain or an entire brain—slicing them into very thin sections, which we incubate with an antibody that labels a specific population of neurons, and we collect that. Or we can load neurons with a fluorescent dye—inject it, using a very thin glass pipette that runs right into the neuron—so then we have a fluorescent neuron!”\n\nHof’s laboratory is full of brains. In a large common lab outside the microscopy rooms, there are shelves holding rows of what look like hinged, dark-wooden cigar boxes. “These are all brains,” Hof says casually. He takes a box down and opens it; inside, there’s a slide with what looks like a small profile of a brain on it. “That’s a human brain. It’s a section, sliced like bread. It looks small, because it was incubated in a chemical process—we started with the entire hemisphere and then incubated it in an alcoholic treatment, and it shrinks by two-thirds. Then you stain it, and there you go.” The brain sections are kept indefinitely, Hof explains, and loaned out, like library books, from lab to lab.\n\nHof, who has taken to studying the brains of whales and dolphins, likes to bring visitors to an open, chilled “brain room,” a sort of rare-book collection of brains, to see a few beautiful instances. The brain room is a revelation. Here they are: human brains, monkey brains, dolphin brains—the space between brain and mind never seems so large as it does when you actually see the material of mind, curved and segmented, as ugly as an intestine, floating in a fixing solution.\n\nThe room even contains a sperm-whale brain—“the largest brain known to the planet,” Hof says. (It looks beautifully broad, with nobly large-spaced convolutions.) Finding the brains of senile cetaceans is hard, he says. “The ones that beach are young adults, and the seniors tend to die quietly at sea.” Hof hopes that insight might be found in studying neurodegeneration in the cetaceans’ more expansive, differently structured cortexes.\n\nThe study of Alzheimer’s became Hof’s special preoccupation because of its insidious destruction of normal minds and normal character. “You can’t tell any difference, even under extreme magnification, between an aging non-demented brain and a younger human one,” he says. “You have to have really fine levels of resolution to see any loss in neural organization just through aging without illness. But, holding an Alzheimer’s brain in your hand, you can see the atrophy.”\n\nThree decades ago, Hof explains, research in Alzheimer’s linked two key proteins with the terrible dissolution of selves: beta-amyloid, which formed plaques between neurons; and tau, which formed tangled fibrils within neurons. The relative importance of the two was disputed, but many scientists concluded that those plaques and fibrils clog the brain as coffee grounds clog a drain. It seemed likely that there would be therapeutic benefits if they could be cleared away. “Now, we know that these are really downstream effects,” Hof says. “What’s happening upstream to cause them is much, much more complicated.”\n\nWith the causes unclear—debate continues over which anomalies are better seen as culprits or as bystanders—and the cure evidently far away, Hof can only enumerate the “co-morbidities” for Alzheimer’s, the conditions that correlate most strongly with its onset. They are the old-fashioned sins: obesity, a lack of exercise, bad diet—and the diabetes that these can produce. For all the cascades of research into longevity, the new science often seems to distill into old wisdom: be fit, stay thin, and you will look and feel younger longer.\n\n“The disease is diverse and heterogeneous enough that treatment and prevention will have to move on several fronts,” Hof says. “First, just promoting healthy aging, what can you do and what can you avoid? Every elder is unique, and will have had life experiences and habits that are unique. So we’re going to have to look at that aspect, in ways that prevent or treat, to a degree, the development of something worse. Then we need to have a better understanding of the causative factors. There are leads that point to a number of interesting markers. There are proteins that play cellular roles that effect a cascade of reaction inside the cells, but it becomes very difficult to target specifically without altering other functions. None of it is easy.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs you take off the *agnes*{: .small} suit—piece by piece; the boots and then the wrist weights and the impeding gloves—the feeling is disconcerting. It’s the return of flow, the feeling of choice and possibility as you begin to move again through the world, that makes you recall that what it is to be young is not to be in a state of ecstasy but merely to be unimpeded, to be in the world without having undue consciousness of your own muscle and bone within it. It’s the same thing we experience when we remove a splinter from our foot; what we get is not happiness in a positive sense but a return to not having to think about the prison and the fact of our flesh. We forget our insides, and fold ourselves back out.\n\nThe true condition of youth is the physical ability to forget ourselves. A friend who is still creative in his eighties points out what he calls the geriatric possessive: people past eighty, he says, are expected to say, “I’m going to take my bath,” “I’m going to take my walk.” We can counterpoise that to the pediatric possessive: “You’re going to take your bath,” “It’s time for your nap.” Only in midlife do we feel secure enough to enumerate actions as existing individually outside our possession of them: “I’m going to take a bath,” “I’m going to take a nap.” A bath and a nap exist, briefly, outside our possession of them—they’re just around for the taking, we suppose, and always will be.\n\nGlenda Jackson, now playing Lear [on Broadway](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/sam-golds-self-serving-vision-of-king-lear) at the age of eighty-three, captures the indomitable egotism of the aged. Watching her onstage, we are asked to recognize not just the anger but also, eventually, the wisdom of age. The old, Shakespeare says, can become, or assist us to become, God’s spies. A decade and a half ago, a Presidential council chaired by the bioethicist Leon Kass produced a report raising questions about research into extended longevity. “Might we be cheating ourselves,” the report asked, “by departing from the contour and constraint of natural life (our frailty and finitude) which serve as a lens for a larger vision that might give all of life coherence and sustaining significance?” We do turn, after all, to the imagery of the old for comfort; we turn to work marked by the frailties of aging for consolation and enlightenment. Matisse, his hands crippled by arthritis, picks up scissors and painted paper and finds a new world of purity; de Kooning, on the edge of Alzheimer’s, paints some of his greatest pictures just as renewed simplicity breaks the hand of excessive excellence.\n\nSwift, in “[Gulliver’s Travels](https://www.amazon.com/Gullivers-Travels-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393957241/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=Gulliver%E2%80%99s+Travels&qid=1557761714&s=books&sr=1-6),” invented the race of the Struldbrugs in order to imagine what eternal life would be like. Eerily, they were given a precise phenotypic marker, a blemish above the left eyebrow, and were given, too, the ill temper associated with age. Promised eternal life, they were cursed with ever-progressing aging, and were the most miserable people alive. What we want—Swift’s point—is not eternal life but eternal youth, and what the new science seems to promise us is more like permanent middle age. We may indeed already be converging as a population—irascible millennials who feel dated at twenty-five and determinedly upbeat boomers who insist on feeling young at seventy—on a single American age, a kind of shared perpetual middleness, where we will dye our hair and take our pills and suddenly collapse in the midst of the dance. Right now, we live well, and then we don’t live well, and then we die. The most that science seems to offer us is this: We’ll live well, and then we’ll die.\n\nIn the past, as science and medicine annihilated old curses, we worried about losing the corresponding compensating benefits. And yet pain in childbirth, which some thought to be foundational to what we call Judeo-Christian morals, could be largely subdued without any loss to mother love; consumption was cured without lessening the romance of romantic poetry. Perhaps the loss of aging will be one more in that series, where, like all the other super-centenarians, we will dance and make love and ski, sharp-eyed, right to the edge of the still inevitable cliff. In the word cloud of concepts associated with aging that hangs in the AgeLab, the word “death” appears only in a tiny balloon, associated with the stray and bubbling thoughts of younger men—much smaller than the other words, lost among larger clouds of hope. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca62bfcc72cd92d0560","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Aging","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"aging"},{"id":"5c2e1c8bee7fe02cbd16334f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Old Age","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"old-age"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e221541e4c73c088d7af6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"massachusetts-institute-of-technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5c2e1e0b4a08312cd3aa6dd4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ageism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ageism"}],"sections":[{"id":"59112c79dd6207318b5dfebc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brave New World Dept.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brave-new-world-dept"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ff4b1c7a8e33fb390bbb","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 1986.

Ratcliffe demanded to know why Mueller had stated in [Volume II](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Muelller-Report-Redacted-Vol-II-Released-04.18.2019-Word-Searchable.-Reduced-Size.pdf) of his report—which investigated whether the President had obstructed justice—that, “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” His voice rising, Ratcliffe [said](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/07/24/rep_ratcliffe_to_mueller_you_didnt_follow_special_counsel_rules_you_wrote_about_decisions_that_werent_reached.html) that the sentence “was not authorized under the law to be written” and violated a “bedrock principle of our justice system.” He urged Americans to ignore the “Democrats and socialists on the other side of the aisle” who cited it. Fact checkers found Ratcliffe’s claims [to be false](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/jul/24/john-ratcliffe/look-whether-robert-mueller-broke-rules-special-co/)*,*{: .small} but he ended his appearance with a dramatic flourish. “I agree with the chairman this morning when he said Donald Trump is not above the law. He’s not,” Ratcliffe said, his voice rising. “But he damn sure shouldn’t be below the law, which is where Volume II of this report puts him.” \n\nIn a Sunday-morning [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il6QX9vqOl8) on Fox News, Ratcliffe again demonstrated his support for the President, declaring that “it was a great week for Donald Trump.” The congressman claimed that Mueller did “not have a command” of what was in the report, which, he said, had been written by “Hillary Clinton’s de-facto legal team.” He said that Trump deserved a presumption of innocence, then added, “What I do know, as a former federal prosecutor, is that it does appear that there were crimes committed during the Obama Administration.” Ratcliffe then praised an unprecedented review that [Attorney General William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/william-barrs-choices) is conducting of the work of the F.B.I. and key intelligence agencies in the launch of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation, saying, “Bill Barr has earned my trust already and the trust of the American people.” \n\nSix hours later, Trump nominated Ratcliffe to be the most powerful intelligence official in the country, replacing Dan Coats, who is stepping down as the director of National Intelligence. Sources told [the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/dan-coats-intelligence-chief-out.html) that Trump enjoyed watching Ratcliffe aggressively question Mueller, but denied that this was the reason the Texas congressman got the job. The Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, disagreed, issuing a statement that said, “It’s clear that Rep. Ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to President Trump with his demagogic questioning of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller.”\n\nIn any event, the dynamic at work is clear. Coats, a leader of the Republican establishment, repeatedly contradicted Trump regarding the threat posed by Russia, and also [publicly questioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-28/dan-coats-plans-to-quit-soon-as-u-s-intelligence-chief) Trump’s optimistic assessments of North Korea’s willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and the extent to which *ISIS*{:.small} has been eradicated. A Trump loyalist who echoes the President’s narratives is now set to take Coats’s job. \n\nMost important, Ratcliffe is a full-throated backer of Trump’s practice of trafficking in conspiracy theories for political gain; he has joined the President’s effort to claim that it wasn’t the myriad contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials that led to Mueller investigation but, rather, that the inquiry was part of a “[deep state](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/21/trump-vs-the-deep-state)” conspiracy. Ratcliffe has repeatedly [claimed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/new-spy-chief-pick-ratcliffe-made-his-name-during-the-trump-inquiries-by-backing-the-president/2019/07/28/f92658ce-b185-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html?utm_term=.efa5471539a3) that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, colluded with Russia and that a cabal of C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials, working with foreign intelligence services, carried out a global conspiracy to entrap Trump aides. \n\nA senior intelligence official recently told me that Barr is personally convinced that there was something nefarious in how the F.B.I. started its investigation in 2016. (The official called the claims of an international plot “preposterous” and pointed out that the Senate Intelligence Committee found them meritless.) If such a plot existed, it would be the largest intelligence scandal in American history; if the Attorney General has clear evidence of it, he should disclose it publicly. \n\nJames Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence—one of the officials whom Barr is reportedly investigating—declined to comment on the Attorney General’s probe and said in an e-mail that it is the President’s prerogative to nominate whom he wishes. But he added that the nomination of a Trump loyalist to replace Coats sends a clear message to members of the intelligence community: “Obviously, the President wants someone in this position whose first priority is loyalty to Donald Trump.” \n\nClapper also expressed concern about the effect that appointing Ratcliffe could have on intelligence officials whose job it is to present apolitical information to policymakers. “I worry about the people in the Intelligence Community, and the impact of being directed to write intelligence analyses that comport with the Presidents’ world view, and not their best judgement as to the facts,” he wrote. “Over time, this could be very dangerous to the country. ‘Truth to power’ is a crucial, rock-bed tenet of US intelligence, and Dan Coats upheld that.”\n\nSenator Angus King, a Maine Independent who caucuses with the Democrats and serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on Ratcliffe. But he, too, [warned of the dangers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/dan-coats-intelligence-chief-out.html) of politicizing intelligence. “We have gotten in trouble in this country in the past when we have cherry-picked intelligence for political purposes or to suit the needs of the President,” he told the *Times*. “That is the worst thing that can happen.”\n\nFor the past forty years, a consensus has existed among Republican and Democratic Presidents, congressional leaders, and senior intelligence officials that the intelligence and law-enforcement communities must be free of political bias. Bipartisan agreement on the issue emerged in the nineteen-seventies, after it was discovered that the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. had for decades spied on Americans engaged in constitutionally protected political activities, from members of the far-right John Birch Society to Martin Luther King, Jr. Richard Nixon’s use of former C.I.A. operatives to carry out “dirty tricks” on his political opponents raised further fears of politicizing the spy agencies. The 2003 invasion of Iraq—based on an incorrect intelligence assessment that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction—showed the dangers of telling a President what he wants to hear. The bitter partisanship that Trump intentionally fuels is eroding a forty-year consensus in Washington regarding the need for apolitical intelligence. Fuelled by Trump, Republicans believe that intelligence agencies are plotting against the President; Democrats, in turn, are convinced the President is silencing intelligence chiefs who disagree with him. \n\nWhether Ratcliffe becomes the director of National Intelligence now rests with the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, which must confirm his nomination, once Trump formally submits it, before passing it on for a full Senate vote. The committee’s chairman, Richard Burr, of North Carolina, has done an admirable job of producing a bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Burr, who is not running for reëlection, is one of a handful of Republican senators with the ability to defy Trump. He reportedly [cautioned the White House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/dan-coats-intelligence-chief-out.html) that Ratcliffe was too political for such a powerful position. Trump named Ratcliffe anyway. \n\n

During [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller)’s five-hour appearance on Capitol Hill, three starkly different story lines emerged. Democrats insisted that Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice and rampant lies. Republicans insisted that Trump was the victim of a vast conspiracy involving a cabal of F.B.I. agents. A final, unexpected narrative was that Mueller, who is seventy-four, was “Dazed and Confused”—as the Drudge Report put it—and unable to clearly answer questions regarding his investigation and report.\n\n \n\nQuestions from Democrats followed a predictable script. Over and over, they tried to coax the former special counsel into recounting the most damaging findings of his report. On some points, Mueller helped. On others, he did not. Mueller said that Russia had systematically intervened in the election to aid [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and that his investigation had not exonerated the President of obstruction. But Mueller [declined to comment](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-unsurprising-recalcitrance-of-robert-mueller-during-his-testimony) on whether Trump should be impeached, repeatedly saying, “I’m not going to talk about that issue.” \n\nQuestions from Republicans drove a polar-opposite narrative: that the Clinton campaign had conspired with Russia against Trump. G.O.P. representatives repeated long-running claims that a group of politically biased F.B.I. officials used a dossier of allegations, funded by the Clinton campaign and assembled by the former British spy [Christopher Steele](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier), to launch a spurious criminal investigation. (F.B.I. officials have said that they launched their investigation based on other evidence, not the dossier.) In some cases, Mueller declined to aid their narrative, stating, “I do not accept your characterization of what occurred.” At another point, though, he did say for the record that he had not uncovered evidence that Russia had compromising material on Trump. \n\n \n\nThe most surprising element—and the one that may impact voters most directly—was Mueller’s own demeanor. At times, he answered questions quickly and directly. He aggressively defended his team, for example, from Republican charges of political bias, calling it “absolutely exemplary.” At other times, the former special counsel appeared confused or unable to hear, asking both Republicans and Democrats to repeat their questions. In a significant gaffe, he answered questions in the morning sessions from the Democrat Ted Lieu and the Republican Ken Buck that [suggested](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/muellers-testimony-strongly-suggests-that-trump-would-be-indicted-if-he-werent-the-president) he believed that Trump had committed a crime. In the afternoon session, he corrected himself and said that he had not arrived at a conclusion about whether Trump had committed a crime. Near the end of his testimony, Mueller also struggled to remember the word “conspiracy.” The Democrat Peter Welch asked whether he had found collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller said, “Well, we don’t use the word ‘collusion.’ The word we usually use is, well, not ‘collusion’ but one of the other terms that fills in when ‘collusion’ is not used.” Welch replied, “The term is ‘conspiracy’ that you prefer to use?” Mueller responded, “&nbsp;‘Conspiracy,’ exactly right.” Voters will find Mueller’s manner a reason to have greater—or lesser—faith in his findings. \n\n \n\nStepping back, the hearings were most remarkable for what they revealed about the state of American politics. Each political party is accusing the other of committing treason. The F.B.I. is being accused of mounting a sham investigation to smear a Presidential candidate. And the President is being accused of attempting to illegally obstruct it. The country is locked in an endlessly escalating political arms race—often based on conspiracy theories—that will intensify through 2020\\. Distrust is the defining dynamic of American politics. The President is the primary instigator. But there are legions of liberals and conservatives eager to think the worst of one another. On Wednesday, Mueller failed to ease that division. It is likely that no one will.

Speaking in lawyerly terms, Mueller said that his report had not exonerated the President on allegations of obstruction of justice. \n\n“The President was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed,” Mueller said.\n\nIn a series of exchanges with the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, and other Democrats, Mueller also confirmed the basic outlines of his report. He said that the Russians engaged in sweeping interference in the 2016 election. And he noted that Trump’s campaign manager shared campaign strategy with a suspected Russian operative. Nadler repeatedly pressed Mueller, however, about his findings on obstruction.\n\n“The President has repeatedly claimed that your report found there was no obstruction, and that it completely and totally exonerated him,” Nadler said. “But that is not what your report said, is it?”\n\n“Correct, that is not what the report said,” Mueller replied. \n\nAfter several other questions, Nadler again asked Mueller the same question. “So the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice,” Nadler said. “Is that correct?”\n\n“That is correct,” Mueller said.\n\nNadler then asked, “And what about total exoneration? Did you actually totally exonerate the President?”\n\n“No,” Mueller replied. \n\nThe hearing then quickly devolved into partisan lines of questioning. Republicans accused Mueller of unfairly smearing the President. Democrats tried to elicit more confirmations from Mueller of the most damaging elements of the report. \n\nMueller, who is seventy-four, struggled to answer some rapid-fire questions from members of Congress. He asked members to repeat their questions or to give him the citations for the section of the report they were citing. He stammered at times. Under attack from Republicans, he largely declined to defend himself.\n\nMore dramatic moments could unfold on Wednesday, but congressional hearings are often summarized by single moments. (Think of President Nixon’s White House counsel, John Dean, describing a “cancer” growing on the Presidency.) \n\nIn the first minutes of Mueller’s testimony, Democrats achieved a basic aim: contradicting Trump’s claims of innocence.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7981ab3335f580f167","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robert Mueller","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"robert-mueller"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Congress","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"congress"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c8741c92e2c9b85da36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mueller Investigation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mueller-investigation"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

Dan Coats, an affable former Republican senator from Indiana, who is the director of National Intelligence; Gina Haspel, a career C.I.A. covert operative who now leads that agency; and Christopher Wray, a former federal prosecutor, who is now the head of the F.B.I., shook hands with the senators and became the focus of attention. \n\nIn the course of two hours, the three officials delivered carefully measured testimony that included pronouncements that would seemingly please the President. “While we were sleeping in the last decade and a half,” Coats said, “China had a remarkable rise in capabilities.” Wray concurred, noting that China has “blurred if not erased” the “line between lawful behavior and fair competition and lying and hacking and cheating and stealing.” And Haspel said that the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “premeditated murder” but declined to state whether Saudi Arabia’s crown prince [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mohammed-bin-salman) was personally responsible.\n\nBut the three chiefs also quietly but clearly disagreed with the President. Coats stated that North Korea was “unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities,” contradicting [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), who has claimed that it might. Wray [said](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4777167/fbi-director-russia-continuing-interference-us-elections) that the Russians had used social media to try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, and were “continuing to adapt their model,” contradicting skeptical comments that Trump has made about Russia’s involvement. And Haspel [said](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4777163/cia-director-iran-technically-compliance-nuclear-deal) that Iran was technically “in compliance” with the nuclear deal that it had struck with the Obama Administration, contradicting claims by Trump that it is violating the terms of that agreement. \n\nMidway through the hearings, news alerts that the intelligence chiefs were openly contradicting Trump’s assertions started hitting mobile phones and television screens. On Wednesday morning, Trump was furious after seeing cable-television news headlines saying that the intelligence chiefs had contradicted him, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/politics/trump-dan-coats-rant/index.html), and he attacked them in [two](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090608298343190528) [tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090609577006112769), without having seen their full testimony. “The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!” Trump tweeted. “Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!” (On Thursday afternoon, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1091088740947320833) a photo of himself meeting with Coats and Haspel in the Oval Office. He suggested that people read the “*COMPLETE*{:.small}” testimony from the hearing, and blamed the media for putting out a “false narrative.”)\n\nThat twenty-four-hour cycle—from a two-hour hearing to two angry tweets—was the latest charged interaction  in the fraught relationship between Trump and the intelligence agencies. In an unprecedented act for a sitting President, Trump has repeatedly accused members of the F.B.I. and other agencies of being part of a “[deep state](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/999242039723163648)” that is trying to oust him from power. His critics say that he is blatantly pressuring the intelligence community to politicize intelligence by producing findings that match his political goals—mirroring a process that was blamed, in part, for the faulty intelligence assessments that helped lead to the invasion of Iraq during the George W. Bush Administration. But the President may also be trying to achieve something simpler: bullying the intelligence agencies into silence.\n\nOn Tuesday, James Clapper, who served as the director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration, told me that the agency heads had spoken “truth to power,” which, he said, is the primary duty of intelligence officers. He also praised them for presenting their findings without flaunting their disagreements with the President. “I think that what happened today is proof positive that the intelligence community, two years into Trump’s term, is still doing its job,” he said.\n\nCurrent and former intelligence officials warned that, within the community, Trump’s rancor is having an impact. Over all, one current senior official said, the community has “hunkered down” to stay focussed on the mission, and senior members try to avoid getting in the President’s cross hairs. The senior official told me that the leaders “of these agencies are exhorting their troops to ignore the political swirl,” telling them to “just get on with your job.” But there is a growing sense that the President and his inner circle are rejecting intelligence assessments that disagree with their views. A former senior intelligence official told me that Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former C.I.A. director and now the Secretary of State, gave analysts “a lot of real pushback” when they told him, in briefings, that Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement. Trump has [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gap-continues-to-widen-between-trump-and-intelligence-community-on-key-issues/2018/12/11/23a02cb0-f8db-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html) taken issue with intelligence briefers on this topic as well.\n\nIn 2017, after transcripts of Trump’s conversations with several foreign leaders leaked to the press, intelligence-agency employees were required to attend seminars in which they were instructed on the damage caused by leaks. “With this President, the political pressure to go after leakers was incredible,” the former official said. More broadly, current and former officials say that a sense of caution has taken hold. Officials often take painstaking efforts to insure that none of their actions can be interpreted as being political—by Trump’s supporters or by his opponents—and that they will not somehow be penalized for their actions in the future. The current senior official said that this caution has not yet resulted in self-censorship within the agencies. “People are extra careful to be nonpolitical,” the official said. “People are doing what they’re doing, they’re just dotting every ‘I’ and crossing every ‘T.’&nbsp;”\n\nYet the former official believes that the feeling that the President and his advisers may dismiss the community’s findings is resulting in a rote production of intelligence. “There is a certain sense of people going through the motions and doing things for the record,” that official told me, because “if the President isn’t interested in the intelligence there is little incentive to go above and beyond and think outside of the box.” The implicit risk is that the community could fail to anticipate the emergence of new threats, as it has been accused of doing before 9/11 and during the 2016 election. \n\nClapper, however, disagreed with this assessment, saying that, for now, he doesn’t think that the analysts have succumbed to political pressure. “I imagine now they are going to be very careful when they’re writing about Russia, or North Korea’s nuclear program,” he said. “I’m sure they’re still writing that stuff. Institutionally, there are too many checks and balances.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to pressure the agencies are particularly unusual, though, because they are public. C.I.A. analysts said that Bush Administration officials accused them of trying to [sabotage the President’s policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/11/world/middleeast/excia-official-says-iraq-data-was-distorted.html) when they questioned intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but the Administration did so in private. Clapper said that Obama never commented, publicly or privately, about testimony that Clapper gave before Congress. “He never said, ‘I’d like you to soft-pedal this, or not that say that.’ Not once.” \n\nThe current and former officials, as well as Clapper, told me that they are most concerned about the long-term impact of the President’s claims that the F.B.I. and C.I.A. are part of the deep state. They worry that such statements will fuel a decline in the willingness of Americans to work for intelligence agencies. “The whole gutting of the institution” is possible, the former official said. “What kind of talent will we attract in the future? That is a huge concern.”\n\nClapper said that he isn’t sure the community can withstand the political pressure in the long term. But, he said, for now, it is performing as it should. “Intelligence people are mindful of history. ‘How will what I write be reflected in the history books? Did I continue to tell the truth?’ The intelligence community will continue to speak truth to power even when the power ignores the truth.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8a36cecf40192141ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Intelligence","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"intelligence"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d5b7e716b454591ae82","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"F.B.I.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fbi"},{"id":"5c2e1d984a08312cd3aa6d49","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"C.I.A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cia"},{"id":"5c2e1e2f2bfcc72cd92d06ff","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Senate Intelligence Committee","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"senate-intelligence-committee"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

His goal was to create a census of the rat population—not to become a footnote in Presidential politics. His estimate of just over two million rats in the city would have been horrifying but for the long-held belief that New York housed equal numbers of rats and humans, as if a municipal sponsor program had assigned each of the eight million New Yorkers a muck-dwelling murine counterpart. The good news was that every four New Yorkers shared just one rat. \n\nAt the time, the data was touted as settling the continual debate over the size of New York’s rat population. But it’s emblematic that it is now pertinent to [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s defamatory attack upon (yet another) American constituency. Trump’s most recent Twitter invective spree targeted Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and the chair of the powerful House Oversight Committee, whose district includes parts of the city of Baltimore, and whose committee is conducting multiple investigations of the President. Trump referred to Cummings’s district, Maryland’s Seventh, as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.” The Baltimore *Sun* shot back with an editorial headlined “Better to have a few rats than to be one.” Trump does not possess great reserves of self-awareness, or else he would have chosen his insult more carefully. Last year, the pest-control company Orkin released its annual list of the “rattiest” cities in the United States, based on how many new rodent treatments the company performed. Baltimore, despite some noted improvements, made the list for the third year in a row, coming in at ninth place. New York came in third—with, again, one rat for every four people. (Chicago came in first, for the fourth year in a row.)\n\n“No human being would want to live there,” Trump said of Baltimore on Twitter, implicitly questioning the humanity of the six hundred thousand human beings who do, in fact, live there. A little more than twenty per cent of the people in Baltimore are under the age of eighteen. How those young people are to find inspiration, cultivate pride in their communities, or gain a sense of their own potential when the President of the United States has called their home unfit for human habitation is a matter that Trump left unaddressed, if that concern even grazed his conscience. His use of the term “human” is implicit code for “white”—it recalled the language of the nineteen-nineties-era Los Angeles Police Department, which often referred to shootings in which both the perpetrator and victim were minorities as N.H.I.s, for “no humans involved.” On Saturday, the CNN anchor Victor Blackwell struggled to maintain his composure as he [spoke about Baltimore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYANRUos8Hg), the city he grew up in; the fully American aspirations of the people who live and work there; and the loaded, racist ways in which Trump has used the term “infested.” Five of the people the President has [most recently singled out](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/donald-trumps-idea-of-selective-citizenship) for condemnation, all members of the House of Representatives, are members of minority communities. \n\nThere are discernibly more rats in New York than there are in Baltimore, but some of the rats in Baltimore have effectively been enabled by New Yorkers—more specifically, Jared Kushner, the New York real-estate baron and Trump’s son-in-law. The [Washington *Post* reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/jared-kushner-owns-lots-of-apartments-in-the-baltimore-area-some-infested-with-mice/2019/07/28/0d3cb754-b13b-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html?utm_term=.3f41dac4fb61) that Kushner’s company has owned some nine thousand apartments in Baltimore that generated, in a single year, more than two hundred complaints of disrepair, code violations, and rodent infestation. The company has been sued and issued financial penalties for failing to address these concerns in a timely manner. \n\nAll of this is immaterial to Trump. His vision of the disparate worlds that the recent targets of his ire come from is uniformly dystopian—a free association of skin color with filth and crime. As President, he has attacked an untold number of individuals—actually, we have [some idea](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/reasons-why-donald-trump-is-unfit-to-be-president) of the number—but the racist themes in his screeds are hard to miss. In 2017, he attacked John Lewis, the civil-rights-movement veteran and Georgia congressman, saying that the Atlanta district that Lewis represents is “crime infested” and “falling apart.” The district is actually home to one of the largest concentrations of college-educated and affluent black people in the country. But that fact was insignificant to Trump, whose rhetoric betrays a kind of mass racial profiling: Lewis is black and so are the majority of his constituents, and we all know what kind of conditions those people live under. Trump said as much in his left-handed appeals to black voters in 2016. “Horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody has seen,” he said. “What the hell do you have to lose?” Self-respect, apparently. \n\nTrump’s use of “infestation” is another metaphor meant to cloak his own culpabilities. He railed about Washington, D.C., being a swamp of corruption before installing his own regime of [Boss Tweedian indulgences](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/watchdog-ben-carsons-table-spending-broke-law/589804/), with multiple Cabinet members accused of ethics violations or graft. He launched his Presidential campaign decrying Mexican “rapists,” only to be accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than twenty women. He frequently bashes black politicians for the poverty in inner cities, although these are places whose well-being he, as President, is responsible for as well. He is not alone in that practice: Republican criticism of Democratic leadership has frequently pointed to poverty in cities where minority populations overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. But ten of the twelve poorest states in the union—Alabama, South Carolina, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, Florida, and Mississippi—are not only led by Republican governors but have legislatures in which the G.O.P. has majorities in both houses. On Sunday morning, when Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, appeared on Fox News to defend Trump, he claimed that he would have been “fired” if there were poverty in his former district, South Carolina’s Fifth, like there is in Baltimore. Critics on social media hastened to point out that Mulvaney’s district was actually slightly *poorer* than Cummings’s is. \n\nThe Baltimore *Sun* further noted that, when Trump referred to the communities that Cummings represents, he omitted more affluent ones such as Ellicott City and Baldwin in favor of the poorer areas of Baltimore—places that he could ridicule en route to making his hyperbolic point. This is the essence of racism: an epidermal association of a group of people with the worst possibilities, even when—especially when—available evidence points to the contrary. \n\nThe human aversion to rats is ancient and abiding. They are vectors of *Clostridium difficile*, salmonella, *E. coli*, and *Leptospira*—consumers of refuse and carriers of pestilence. The evidence of their presence is noted by burrows in the earth; droppings, which may cause asthma; and the greasy trail that they frequently leave in their wake. They inspire disgust for good reason and yet, for all their liabilities, they possess a singular virtue that Donald Trump lacks: they make no attempt to deny what they actually are.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

earliest moments of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s political life that the epidermal lottery into which we are all cast is, to him, more than happenstance. Pigment is something foundational—a navigational star in the night sky of his world view. When a man introduces himself to the American electorate by lying about the origins of the first black President, and then proceeds to baselessly refer to Mexicans in the United States as rapists, nothing he does after that can be considered surprising.\n\nIn that regard, Trump’s eruption last week, in which he attacked (but did not name) Representatives [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party), Ayanna Pressley, [Ilhan Omar](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/ilhan-omars-embattled-first-months-in-office), and Rashida Tlaib, tweeting that they should “go back” to where they came from, and later accused them of hating America, could not be called unexpected. It was alarming, though, and it raised the question, once again, of whether Trump had finally gone too far. For the past two years, observers have been divided about whether Trump’s tweets are calculated trolling, designed to keep his opponents off balance, or the sincere expressions of an unbalanced psyche. The current outburst indicates that the answer is both.\n\nBefore Trump intervened, the story in the media was about the roiling conflict between the congresswomen—the so-called Squad—and House Speaker [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), this time over border policy. Trump, in suggesting that the four U.S. citizens self-deport, prompted the Speaker to stop sniping at them and to fire back at him. Trump’s real agenda, she said, is about “making America white again.” Last Tuesday, Republicans in the House of Representatives were forced to go on the record about the incident, when that chamber voted on a resolution condemning the tweets, which Pelosi termed “racist.” Her comment was, technically, a violation of House rules and it was “taken down,” but she did not apologize. Only four Republicans supported the resolution.\n\nMost likely, Trump never considered what consequences his attack would have on Capitol Hill. He seems to think that his outré rage at the four women—They are not white, they are radicals, and only I can save you from what they will bring—will play well to his base, and that’s all that matters. He revealed as much when he told reporters that he is “enjoying” the fight and thinks that he is “winning it by a lot.” A majority of people polled found Trump’s tweets offensive and “un-American,” but his approval ratings rose among Republicans.\n\nWith his habitual grandiosity, Trump has previously declared himself “the least racist person anybody is going to meet.” (Last Tuesday, he tweeted, “I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!”) By way of evidence, he repeatedly commits the defensive racist’s primary tell: listing the names of all the black people he knows, like a roster of character witnesses in a criminal trial. This most recent incident highlights a theme of Trump’s pronouncements as they pertain to people of color. He presents the citizenship of black and brown Americans as a kind of probation that can be revoked for the most minor infractions of protocol.\n\nIlhan Omar is a Somali-born refugee who became a naturalized U.S. citizen at the age of seventeen. She is American enough to serve in Congress but not enough for Trump, who has shown an increasing disregard for the very principle of asylum. Rashida Tlaib was born in Detroit, to immigrant parents. Ayanna Pressley was born, to African-American parents, in Cincinnati. Her family has been here longer than Trump’s, and, as African-Americans, they are part of a population that was forcibly brought to this country to do its labor. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, to parents of Puerto Rican descent, which means that, even if she did go back to where her ancestors came from, she would still be in America.\n\nThe idea of selective citizenship is not uncommon in American history. The nation’s first immigration law, passed in 1790, allowed for the naturalization of white immigrants only. It took the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1868, to establish that birthright citizenship also applies to blacks. As Jill Lepore notes, in her book “This America,” another thirty years passed before the Supreme Court found, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that birthright citizenship applies to a person of Asian descent, and it was another quarter century before the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 declared that all indigenous people born in the United States are citizens. Trump isn’t just attacking four women of color; he is reanimating ideas whose prevalence wreaked havoc in the nation’s past.\n\nWe were reminded, last week, of something that we have known all along about the President: he will say anything that he thinks will serve his ends, regardless of the risk it may pose to his fellow-Americans. According to the F.B.I., hate crimes rose by seventeen per cent during his first year in office. Last year, a man who described his attachment to Trump’s rallies as a kind of addiction, mailed explosive devices (which did not detonate) to various media outlets and politicians whom he considered to be the President’s enemies. The worry is that Trump’s most recent fulminations will find their way to other vulnerable and dangerous observers.\n\nHis behavior carries another significant implication. The conflict between Pelosi and the Squad centered on votes for a border-funding bill, but it has at its root a more fundamental conflict: progressive legislators want to launch an impeachment inquiry, while Pelosi fears that it would only help Trump win reëlection. After the Mueller report was released, Tlaib recirculated a resolution, which she had previously introduced, to launch such an inquiry; the other members of the Squad signed on to it. More than eighty House Democrats have now called for an inquiry. Last Wednesday, the House [voted to table](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-movement-to-impeach-donald-trump-has-only-just-begun) the latest impeachment resolution from Representative Al Green (his third), but ninety-five Democrats voted to keep it on the floor. Pelosi reportedly told senior House Democrats last month that she would rather see Trump in prison than impeached. His ineptitude may yet spur the two factions toward a productive rapprochement. Robert Mueller’s testimony before two House committees, which is scheduled for this week, may further clarify the resolution.\n\nHas Trump finally gone too far? A few hours after the House vote, he addressed a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, in which he renewed his attacks on the congresswomen, and said that Democrats were set on “the destruction of our country,” as his followers chanted, “Send her back!” The next day, he claimed that he was “not happy” with the chants, and tried to stop them, but he did not. The evidence of Trump’s unfitness for the Presidency—whether it is calculated or simply deranged—is inescapable. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca141c92e2c9b85da59","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pres.

Common Cause, it legitimized one of the cornerstone elements of voter suppression in the United States. The Court ruled that the federal government could not impede partisan gerrymandering on the state level, even while conceding that gerrymandering might produce unjust outcomes. Aided by new software that maximizes partisan advantage, state legislatures, which are overwhelmingly in the hands of Republicans, have redrawn voting districts largely to the disadvantage of Democrats. The technology has enabled gerrymandering to such an extent that it effectively nullifies the possibility of equal representation for voters. In 2012, Wisconsin Democrats won just over fifty-one per cent of votes in legislative elections; they came away with just thirty-nine of the legislature’s ninety-nine seats. By contrast, Republicans in the 2014 elections won fifty-two per cent of the votes, and that translated into sixty-three seats.\n\nThe North Carolina legislature, which has consistently been challenged for voting policies that negatively impact minority voters, in 2016 created [a map so heavily gerrymandered](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-north-carolina-gerrymander-map-supreme-court/) that the districts resembled abstract art. The legal challenge from the government watchdog organization Common Cause held that such nakedly partisan districting violated the First Amendment rights of people living in districts that stood little chance of electing someone who shared their political outlook. (A second case, Lamone v. Benisek, involved an accusation of gerrymandering that favored Democrats in Maryland.) \n\nThere is nothing novel about the tactic—the word “gerrymander” dates back to 1812, when Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, signed a bill that redrew district lines in ways that favored his Democratic-Republican Party. By 1868, the National Encyclopedia referred to gerrymandering as “a method of arranging election districts so that the political party making the arrangement will be enabled to elect a greater number of representatives than they could on a fair system, and more than they should have in proportion to their numerical strength.”\n\nYet gerrymandering’s long history should not be mistaken for inevitability. Three years ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote an opinion, in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, that pointed to the importance of impartial redistricting commissions, which could “impede legislators from choosing their voters instead of facilitating the voters’ choice of their representatives.”\n\nThe Rucho decision comes in the context of a broader assault on the rights of voters and the electoral system. The current attack, like much of American politics today, is directly rooted in a fear of the United States becoming a society in which minorities make up the majority of the population. It is not coincidental that Rucho arrived at the Court at the same time as a case regarding the [Trump Administration](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/trump-administration)’s plans to include a question about [citizenship status](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-motives-behind-the-trump-administrations-new-census-question-on-citizenship) on the census. Following the death of the Republican strategist Thomas Hofeller, his daughter Stephanie Hofeller turned over e-mails in which he argued that including a citizenship question on the census [would help Republicans](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-there-racist-intent-behind-the-census-citizenship-question-wilbur-ross) create even more gerrymandered districts. The Court rejected an argument that a citizenship question needed to be added in order to better adhere to the Voting Rights Act—a position of transparently bad faith, given that the question would likely decrease minority electoral participation, rather than facilitate it. The majority ruling, however, implied that some other justification for adding a citizenship question to the census might prevail. (On Tuesday, the Administration announced it would drop its efforts to add a citizenship question to the census.)\n\nIn an era when Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have rendered undocumented people afraid of going to their [workplaces](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-arrests-more-280-texas-business-biggest-workplace-immigration-raid-n990766), [schools](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/12/us/tennessee-immigration-raid-schools-impact/index.html), and [churches](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sacramento-church-ice-deportation-fears-20170519-htmlstory.html), or of travelling by [bus](https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses/greyhound-has-choice-warrantless-searches) or [airplane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/23/federal-agents-ask-domestic-flight-passengers-to-show-ids-in-search-for-undocumented-immigrant/?utm_term=.a6a887153c6f), the presumption should be that census data showing where undocumented families reside would be a tool for mass deportations. The net effect of this would be a population undercount, and, therefore, a skewed understanding of which areas warrant additional representation in Congress, education funds, and social services. Given voting patterns in the United States, partisan gerrymandering does not simply place one political party at a disadvantage. It places certain groups at a disadvantage. The vast majority of African-Americans and significant numbers of Latinos vote Democrat, and those groups will be adversely impacted by policies that make it more difficult for the Democratic Party to win elections. When Justice Elena Kagan remarked in her dissent on Rucho that the use of Big Data technology to intensify gerrymandering “imperils our system of government,” she was not being hyperbolic. The precision of these districts will generate Republican majorities that will then retain the power to draw even more favorable districts, in a tribalistic feedback loop.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, holding, in part, that the law unfairly assumed racial bias on the part of white Southerners. Yet the segregationist South is the direct inspiration for the current wave of challenges to voter access. Voter suppression in the days prior to the 1965 Voting Rights Act was not solely a means of enforcing the racial subordination of black people. It carried distinct partisan advantages for the Democrats, who dominated the region politically. The Fifteenth Amendment, which enfranchised black men, was part of a calculation meant to produce more Republican voters. By disenfranchising black voters, white segregationists simultaneously enshrined one-party Democratic rule in the South. The parties have essentially switched positions, and we are now talking about a national phenomenon, not a regional one, but the underlying dynamic remains the same. \n\nLast year, the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute upheld an Ohio law that allowed states to purge names from voting rolls if those persons had not voted recently or not returned a mailer affirming their address. That process echoes mechanisms like poll taxes that were used to racially curate voter rolls in the Deep South. (Last week, Florida’s governor [signed into law](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/florida-felons-voting-rights.html) a poll tax that countermanded a 2018 referendum, supported by sixty-four per cent of voters, that [restored voting rights](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-fight-for-voting-rights-in-florida-isnt-over) to people convicted of certain felonies.)\n\nIt is convenient but wrong to believe that the primary threat to American democracy is an abnormal President and the possibility of continued Russian interference in our elections. The far larger concern is the behavior of government institutions that are, as part of their daily, normal functioning, eroding even the pretense of equality. The nation’s politics are not only driven by a vengeful, paranoid demagogue who has exacerbated white fears of demographic change and strives to reënshrine archaic bigotries. Now, five Supreme Court Justices, presumably more staid, more conscientious, and more rational than the President, have aided him in that cause.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"},{"id":"5c2e1c96e56e652c9027468c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Supreme Court","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"supreme-court"},{"id":"5c2e1c9c7e716b454591add8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gerrymandering","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gerrymandering"},{"id":"5c2e1c9a36cecf401921420a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Voter Suppression","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"voter-suppression"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c957a4e65be2f29d55262","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.
