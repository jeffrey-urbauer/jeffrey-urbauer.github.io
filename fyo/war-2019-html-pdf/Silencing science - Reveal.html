					<p>President Donald Trump says he doubts humans have much of a role in climate change. His administration has downplayed the science of climate change and sought to silence scientists working for the federal government. In this hour, Reveal’s Elizabeth Shogren details the pressures one researcher faced as she worked on a project for the National Park Service.</p>

<h2>A big storm could submerge Canaveral National Seashore</h2>
<p>If greenhouse gas emissions keep growing and a category 3 hurricane were to hit Florida&#8217;s Canaveral National Seashore in 2050, the whole national park will be under water, according to projections by scientist Maria Caffrey and the National Park Service. Thousands of sea turtle nests could be be washed away, and archaeological sites, park buildings, roads and boardwalks all will be at risk.</p>
<p>Calculations of sea level rise and storm surge can help park service personnel protect natural and historic treasures at parks and help the public know what&#8217;s at stake in climate change. But under President Trump, the park service long suppressed this research. Now that it&#8217;s out, the agency hasn&#8217;t publicly spread the word that this trail-blazing science is available for 118 national parks.</p>

<td>Hey, hey, hey, Revealers. This is my last chance in 2018 to remind you how hard we've been working to bring you stories that make the world a better place. And it's also my last opportunity to remind you that we need your help so we can do a lot more in 2019. This work, investigating the powerful, uncovering secrets others are trying to keep hidden, takes time and skill, and costs money, a lot of it. We make this show for you, our listeners, and we're a nonprofit that also depends on you. We can't produce Reveal without your help. We need as many of you as possible to join us by becoming a Reveal member. Any amount, any at all, helps. So please, text the word DONATE to 63735, and we'll get back to you so you can tell us what you want to give. You know the drill. Standard texting and data rates apply. And hey, as an extra thank you, if you donate by January 4th, we'll send you a brand spanking-new Reveal T-shirt. To see what it looks like, just text the word DONATE right now, 63735, and we'll send you a gift of yours truly looking super fly in that Reveal Tee. Listen, you love us, we love you, let's make it official and do some good work together.</p>

<td>I grew up over by Heathrow Airport, so it was airplanes and roads and congestion, and stuff like that. I think that's why I got into environmental science, it was just so foreign to me.

<td width="94">Elizabeth:</td>
<td>She's an idealist. She picked climate change because she hoped her science would have a positive impact on the world. Under President Obama, addressing climate change was a top priority, so being a climate scientist was kind of like being an astronaut in the 1960s, that's when President Kennedy challenged Americans to beat the Soviet Union to the moon. In 2012 Maria launched her big mission, to come up with estimates of how much flooding could be expected in National Parks because of climate change. It was heady stuff. She was a University of Colorado scientist, contracted by the National Park Service. She'd just started on this work when New York got hammered by Hurricane Sandy.</p>

Park rangers urgently needed her estimate of how high flood waters had gotten at the Statue of Liberty. She crunched the numbers in about an hour, and got her estimate to park managers, but she felt parks should have had that kind of information long before storms hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</td>

<td width="94">Maria C:</td>
<td>It's really important to have that information way in advance, before that storm ever happens. When a storm's coming in, park staff are scrambling to get ready for the storm, right? So they can't sit on a phone call with a scientist.</p>

<td>There'd been lots of changes. The early drafts had many references to humans causing climate change and flooding the national parks, then about a year after Trump became president, after the report had been considered final for months, the changes started showing up. Park officials commented that this was really unusual. For instance, the first sentence of the executive summary ready, "Anthropogenic climate change presents challenges to national park managers."</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="94">Elizabeth:</td>
<td>Right, it's the scientific term for people causing something. A version from January 2018 dropped the word anthropogenic and other references to people causing climate change. I could see that those changes were made by a Park Service spokesman and the head of the Park SErvice's Climate Change Response Program. That's the part of the Park Service that's supposed to help parks get ready for climate change. They'd scrubbed the report of all mentions of humans causing climate change. An email exchange showed their boss had just communicated his "anthropogenic concerns."</p>

Her name is Betsy Von Holle, and when we spoke on the phone she told me Maria Caffrey's data has been crucial to her research. We scheduled an interview, but the day before we were going to meet, she abruptly canceled. I tried to figure out what happened. I made a public records request for emails between her and the Park Service. Remember Mike Litterst the Park Service spokesman who showed me the flooding National Mall?</p>

<td>One of the emails I got shows Litterst and another Park Service official pressuring the scientist. They tell her it would not be prudent to do an interview. No one from the Park Service would give me a straight answer. It started to seem like a deliberate strategy, certainly it's in line with President Trump's intention to downplay the science of climate change. In fact, Maria Caffrey told me she was instructed that the Park Service works for Trump and not the American people.</p>

I knew about the research Maria Caffrey was doing, so when it didn't come out I knew something was up, but I keep thinking there must be other research being censored that we just don't know about. We do know about some other examples, though. A national park in Massachusetts was told to delete every mention of climate change in its planning document, 16 different mentions. They were told it was just too sensitive, and it's happening across the federal government.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="94">Al Letson:</td>

The future though is that parts of the United States will be under water, there could be severe droughts, all sorts of things.</p>

But I do think when it comes to what's tangible and what people can look at and measure right now, it's far easier to see what the impacts are on US power if we lose our manufacturing base, then it is to try to determine what are the long-term climate impacts with sea level rise, et cetera.</p>

I think the president says, "Look, I was focused on making sure that the United States was in a position to meet the challenge represented by China. That China clearly has geopolitical ambitions so, therefore, as the president I've gotta think about the more immediate threat to the United States, and that's what I'm focused on."</p>
