Subject:  Academic Policy Changes for Fall 2008

As you may be aware, there are a few policy changes
approved by University Council that will go into effect
with the start of the Fall 2008 semester.

  1)The Drop/Add period has changed slightly - for
    all courses, there is now an extra day for adding
    courses only.  The Drop/Add dates for undergraduate
    and graduate level courses are below.

    For registration of an undergraduate level course
    (courses numbered 0097-5999), the Drop/Add dates are:
    Drop/Add Begins: Monday, August 18, 2008 at 7:00am
    Drop Deadline: Thursday, August 21, 2008 at midnight
    Add Deadline: Friday, August 22, 2008 at midnight

    For registration of a graduate level course (courses
    numbered 6000-9999), the Drop/Add dates are:
    Drop/Add Begins: Monday, August 18, 2008 at 7:00am
    Drop Deadline: Monday, August 25, 2008 at midnight
    Add Deadline: Tuesday, August 26, 2008 at midnight

  2)The Withdrawal Deadline is now two weeks after the
    semester midpoint.  The Withdrawal Deadline for Fall
    2008 is Thursday, October 23, 2008.

    The grading system for withdrawals has changed. The
    W (Withdrawal) has been changed to a WP (Withdrawal
    Passing).

  3)For undergraduate students, there is now a limit of
    four (4) career withdrawals at UGA before all
    subsequent withdrawals receive an automatic grade
    of WF (Withdrawal Failing).  The count will begin
    Fall 2008 regardless of when a student matriculated
    and of any withdrawals in previous terms.  All
    withdrawals are included in the count except:
    Hardship Withdrawals, Withdrawals from Audited
    Courses, and Military Withdrawals.

  4)In order to administratively withdraw a student for
    non-attendance after the drop deadline and before
    the withdrawal deadline, you will now need to send
    an email to the Office of the Registrar at
    regsupp@uga.edu.  Please include the student's name,
    his/her 810 number, the course and call number.
    Please indicate whether the assigned grade should be
    a WP or a WF.

Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Office
of the Registrar at (706)542-8771 during normal business
hours.  After hours, assistance is available from the EITS
Helpdesk at (706)542-3106.  You may also email the Office
of the Registrar at regsupp@uga.edu for assistance.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and assistance.
